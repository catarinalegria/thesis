You understood that?
Consider it done.
You think I should?
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Awww. Bye!
Bye Chandler.
Listen to me!!
People need juice!
Thank you, Joey.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
Oh uh, when?
Yeah, she broke up with me.
So take care.
Wasn't it?
What? That's terrible!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Not so much!
Relax your hand!
...betrothed couple.
Betrothed...
Again, what?!
Because it kinda looked like I did.
Any contact?
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Fancy guest.
Guest.
Janice, you're--
Hey, it's everybody.
Joey... Switzerland?
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Sure! Alright...
Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
Well, I like danger.
Well, it's kinda dangerous.
No, you're the best.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
You must stop!
Shut up!
You said no right?
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
I didn't realize that.
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
Excuse me. Hi.
Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
No he didn't.
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
I don't have a page.
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Thank you, Ross.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Tell me more.
Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
Aren't you...?
Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .
Damn Rollos!
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Erica wait!
I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
Great novels?
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
See? Intuitive!
I'm adopted?!
Oh yeah, totally!
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
What? What? Why?!
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
All right, ready?
I think you're right.
Yeah, he's better!
No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
I don't want to look.
Could you not look?
I think it's necessary.
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
I think it's winning.
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Did she call?
What the heck is that?
Ok, you can have it.
Give it to me.
Well, somebody should.
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
And we're changing.
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
I'm not moving out.
Why, are you moving out?
You know the hotels?
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Then it's okay!
No.
I didn't think I was!
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
And say nothing?
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Honey, I'm old!
So far so good!
I gotta stop this.
Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
Well, I'm there too!
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
Do we dare?
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Oh my good God.
Damnit Carl!
Why her mom?
Well, how bout just her mom?
What is going on?
There it is.
You're okay there?
I love it, when we share.
What Richard thing?
Oh no.
There are seven?!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
How's it going?
How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
Is that a problem?
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Here in Chelsea.
Where is this party?
Do you know why?
Yeah, they don't like you.
It's happened to you?
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
No. Not anymore.
Are you being British?!
Really? Okay. Great!
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
...And boogie!
Get down?
8. 8!
Pick a number! That is your only job!
Atlantic City!
Okay, let's go!
BEND OVER?!!!
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Central Perk?
What's my last name?
Consider Casey.
No. No, Kathy.
Dangerous Liaisons.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Don't, don't!
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Yes it is. See.
F-hah.... flennin....
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Still broken?
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Then...who did?
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Too dry.
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Very informative!
Excellent!
What gay thing?
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
I have some moves.
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Oh-I don't know.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
They loved it.
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
I'm still right here!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
And then Tineals.
All right, we have to pick captains.
You mean the spitter?
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
But you found me!
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Yeah, I think it is!
Oh, okay.
My-Oh my God!
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
I'm off the list.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
Thank you, sir.
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
It's a beautiful thing.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
I KNEW IT!!!!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
That's what you got me?
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Okay, you are new!
You don't like puppies?
What did you just do?
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Let it go!!
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Can you hear that?
There you go.
Come on! Joe!
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
To the bathroom!
Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?
So, who does?
It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
He's got nothing!
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
Could be Casey.
No-no, Kathy.
Did you hear that?
You'd better run!
Okay, one more time.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
"The Firm"?
Name one of his books.
...I dunno.
Second date!
...and beer!!
More foosball?
Aaaaand....... hernia.
Someday.
American Express?
What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
I think it's sweet.
Bye, momi-moo.
Uh, bye Monica.
Easy Lenny.
Oh, well no problem there.
Easy tiger.
Yeah!! Yeah!
Ohh. Mmm.
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
That-that's bad?
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
Man, this is...
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
You're kidding right?
A four and a nine.
But I just wa...
No, but you can't.
...I'm, I'm okay.
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Men are here.
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Where are you going?
Alright, I'll be right back.
It's a great idea.
Okay!
I don't know. Maybe.
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Yeah you can do it.
So I can do it?
You made pottery?
Hey! I made that for her!
Well there you have it!
Not really.
How do you do that?
Wait here. Breathe.
Does it matter?!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
We still got it!
Sorry...we were just leaving.
Does Ross know?
She said yes.
Well, we don't want that.
No that could kill her.
Hi, Just Janice.
Hello, funny Valentine.
When we were?
He's... our age.
What are you singing?
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
What are you supporting?
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
What are you talking...
No it is not!
What are you writing?
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
Really?! You do that?
Well, I could cut it.
I love you so much.
Uh-hmm.
You're in my seat.
What?
I hate this thing!
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Well, it is overdue.
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
And there's daddy!
Hello darlings.
Yeah, it is the best.
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Aw, don't do that
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Kinda like Joey.
Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
I feel so used.
That's right, I got mine.
I know, I can do this.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I'm coming already!!
All right!!
Where is Emily?
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
I am sorry, Ross.
I am sorry, Chandler.
I'm not seeing Monica.
Have you seen Monica?
Okay, hating this.
Save it.
"Big guy?"
No? What happened, big guy?
Coffee house?
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Condoms, dude!
What do you got there?
Good-bye muscles!!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Knock, knock.
Did you make brownies today?
Or... Dick.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Theyre twins!
Im sayin I see a difference.
Wrong number?
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
We're growing up.
And a baby...
What's your point?
Why?
Where have you been?
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
You mean with Casey.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
Okay. What was tonight?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Oh, hey guys!
Hey! Look who I found!
Well, close to...
How much?
What about the birds?
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Hey, is Rachel here?
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
We have to leave!!
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Are you all right?!
WHAT?!!
But we don't do that.
Well, not anymore.
You got your passport?
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
Okay. It's a chicken.
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
I didn't mean now...
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
Do we have to?
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
I hope he did!
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
oh it was great.
: Hi, how was your flight?
What are we gonna do?
Yeah!
What's in the bag?
Hey.
You couldn't be cool.
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
You're our age!
Okay.
And then he did.
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
But you come first!
It's in Barbados.
Oh, well, that's great!
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Having a swim.
What 'cha doing?
Sure I would!
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
What does she do?
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
I can't belive it.
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
Games and stuff.
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
How did you...know?
Wash your hands!!!
Is Monica not here?
Hi sweetie!
How is that worse?!
What?!! That's even worse!!
Please, just do it!
I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Is that a swing?
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
We said seven!
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Please, come in.
Hi, glad you could come.
I just feel awful.
Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Look, if you did...
Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Almost over man.
Hey! Is the show still on?
What we want honey.
Hey, I know I what I want!
Oh-no, he's right.
You think?
Yes, we were just...
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Nope, not this time.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Well, yeah actually.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Honey, you're screaming.
I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Hey, where you been?
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
This is harder than I thought it would be.
Ok, that's Eric.
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Heads it is.
Heads.
I'll talk to them!
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
Well, what'd you do?
Yeah! Once.
I'll be right with you.
Chandler!
Then it's okaaay!
No.
Where's your passport?
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
What did I just say?
But you are a liar.
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Yes?
Thank you, buddy.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Well, that went well.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
So.... I quit.
That's great!
Yes, I realise that.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
That's sweet, Joey.
That's very nice.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Of course.
Get there faster!
Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
Yeah, we are so sorry.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
. Well played.
Joey's bare ass!
Ah, there we go.
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
How are you feeling?
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
"Benefits lapsed."
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
"Smoke away."
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
4:00 A.M.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
ADRIENNE TURNER!!
NO!
Art lover!
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
I can't believe we live here!
Diet soda.
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
Emotional Knapsack?
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
FREE PORN!!!
Yeah.
Funniest? Heckles?
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Hmm mmmhm..
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
Maureen Rosilla.
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Mazel tov!
Oh, just had a baby.
Mrs Hannigan?
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
Much sense?!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Mustached bastard...
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Orange juice.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Perfect decibel.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Peter Parker.
Hardy Boy.
Pierce Brosnan?
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Probably because...
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
RAT BASTARD!
Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.
Really, bitchin'!
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Cool!!
Scared? Happy?
No, I mean happy.
Slim Pickings.
That's so sweet. Find anything?
Toootal chick-flick.

USA Today.
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. Ross: What did you get?
Whoa ho.
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
YEAH!!! YES!!!
Oh my God.
Yea yea.
So sexy. Honey.
How do you feel?
I'm really happy for you guys.
How do you know?!
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Ok, here we go!
Oh, play them!
From a bullet!
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
I think you smell great!
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
I don't sound like that.
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
You knew about this?
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Okay, okay, you got it!
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Yeah. No. No...
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Oh, hello Rachel.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Then, I don't get it.
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Ohhh. Don't go.
I'm sorry.
So how are you doing?
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
We'll watch him.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
Sure, why not?
I am?
We're in a relationship?
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
Well believe it baby!
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
I'm *happily* married.
So? I'm married.
Sure. What's up?
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
No, ten o'clock.
Is it? Feels like two.
I'm not playing with you.
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
Come on, Rach.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Well ah, ........y'know.
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
What? What can't you do?
We can't do that.
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Oh, no. Oh, no.
What are you doing here?
Hi. Hi.
The nerve huh?
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
What'd you rent?
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
What do you think Pheebs?
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
I'm not yanking you.
Come on, quite yankin' me.
I broke up with her.
So how was Joan?
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Nooo!
Hi! How are you?
Yeah!
You mean they like you.
But they like it!
Where ya going?
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
Umm, this is nice.
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
What are you guys doing?
Oh Willie's still alive!
Oh, what's the matter?
Hey!
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
And I'm cute too.
That's okay.
'Cause it's gross.
Why not?
Yes that was mine.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
It was my racquet.
I was frustrated.
Great!! That's great!
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
She was a welder.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
Oh, you get used to it.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
I don't like your massages.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
You see what I mean.
I used to have that bumper sticker.
Oh, so you're divorced?
Ooooohhh.
Oh that's too bad.
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Okay, that hurt us.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
Me?! Why me?
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
That's totally understandable.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
Well, that can't be good!
Oh! They're in the table!
You have gotta stop!
God works in mysterious ways.
...Quality, right, great.
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
You want some help.
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
So what'd you do?
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Come on, tell me.
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Okay. It's a racecar.
It's Monica's bed. What?
Ross, don't. Ross!
We're kidding!
We don't, really.
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
What is going on here?
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
We still have porn.
Oh no-no-no!
Can I get a beer.
Got me.
Count of three?
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
What are you going to do?
Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves.
Well, I did not know that.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Jeez, what a baby.
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Yes! Well that-yes.
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Isn't this amazing?
Janice?!
How do ya do.
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
The one that doesn't.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
You are going downer!
Please, you're going down!
Wow, this is weird.
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
They don't have those.
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
That's okay, we understand.
You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
I bet he can.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Aww, thanks man.
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
So, what do you think?
Paolo made a pass at me.
Alright, let's do this.
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
Monica and I are engaged.
What's up?
Can I be that guy?
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Let's go quicker.
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Wish me luck.
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Will you marry me?
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Well, I guess that's something.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Hey! Happy birthday.
Hey!
It's not all juice!
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
I do not hate Ross!
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Here just...take this.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
What is it doing here?
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
Bye! Thank God
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
That's right! I'm not!
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Y'know what would work?
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Why would you say that?
Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
Thats a bear.
Ok! I want the dolphin!
We're worried about you.
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
I respectfully disagree.
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!
Shall I carve?
It's nice that he has someone.
Hang on buddy!
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Really? Are you sure?
No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Could I borrow it?
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together.
You have done enough!
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
What? May I?
If you want to check your email, just ask!
Why am I looking?
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Are we in London?
Oh, that is better.
What are you talking about?
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
We are bad people.
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
What's wrong with you?
What?!
Do I look fat?
Hey.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Umm...
Check out the ring.
Where's all the tissues?!
You said no right?!
Huh?
No problem roomie.
Thank you.
Yes, yes eight.
Come on eight.
You don't trust him?
Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Whoa, she's pretty.
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
I-I think we have too.
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Yeah, you're right about that.
No, it's too soon for you guys.
So how'd it go?
She's still asleep.
We actually missed it.
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Okay, fine, $300.
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
One more game?
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Oh yeah? That's great!
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
You wanna share it?
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
I sent them home.
Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
Hey, that was really good!
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Because we hate them.
Why not?
Monica's a little drunk.
Hey, what's going on?
Oh, they're a hoot.
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
That's what you should say.
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
Emma was doing it!
What are you doing?
No. No! No! No!
No, I-I-I gotta go.
That's what Monica said.
What?! Tonight?!
You okay over there?
Oh, thanks.
No I-I-I'm fine.
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
So what are you gonna do?
Thanks Rach.
That's still in there?!
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Hi, how are ya?
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
No! You're the sweetest!
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
Lying is wrong!
Now, what do you say?
Maybe not even then.
Like only if the queen comes?
Who's he huggin'?
That's Bill Clinton.
Okay, keep saying it!
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
What the hell is this?
You guys hear a ringing?
Hey, mister tux!
Hey!
No thanks, I'm good.
Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
You're kidding, no!
You're kidding!
May I help you?
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
We're moving to Tulsa.
No.
Screw the Knicks!
It's the Knicks!
Okay to come in?
Try telling my wife that.
Chicks don't swim.
What about the chick?
Oh my... God?
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
The hot chicks?
Okay, okay take a guess.
What time is it now?
Uh, 10:30.
That was so lame.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
It's a buffet man.
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Mon, get out here!
Hey Mon.
Did you see Betty?
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
This is not a sign!
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
It's Clint! Clint!
Bye, Gene.
Relax your hand!
What?
Fine, let's do it.
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Ross, ten o'clock.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
How drunk are you?
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Like an eclipse.
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Then don't leave me!
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
But we should take it.
No so we're protecting her.
Why?! What happened?!
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
That's me! Come on!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
I can't believe you did this.
I know-
What a sweet story.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What's the matter Joe?
Bye honey.
What, what, what?!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
Oh sweet Moses.
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
Yeah, I'll go get one.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
I don't think that's exactly...
You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
Hey! How was lunch?
That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
You mind if I...
Hi.
No!! You can't!!
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
What are you doing tonight?
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
I will have one.
So how's Mindy?
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
What, like a number?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
No, I'm alright, thanks.
Do you want a refill?
No, there were two.
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
Oh, the mixed tape.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Not fun anymore?
Please! I made this game what it is.
Hey! How'd it go?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Oh, good job Joe.
All right!!
All yours babe.
What?
I'm begging you stop.
Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
I think these are yours.
Yeah!
Why can't you tell her?
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Oopsey, missed it!
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Yeah, like in a cab...
For the ride.
Plus, you look cool.
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Hey! Ready to go?
AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
I thought it was $98.50.
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
First of the month.
Right! And when is that due?
Robert's coming out.
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
Why is that so funny?
Yeah right.
Know what I mean?
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
How do you figure that?
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Oh my God! Play!
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
I Gotcha!!
Yep, pretty much.
So you two are really serious?!
So I got ya something.
No, we're alright.
Yeah, I'll sit down.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
All right I'll have one.
No, no, it's just my tooth.
Honestly? Me too.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
I just wan't to...
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
You don't like that show?
Y-, y-, you like that show?
Oh, this is not that bad.
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
So, what are you gonna do?
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
A face ass?
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
Oh, DAMN IT!
Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
Oh, my, god!
Helloo!!
Dude, you're shaking!
C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Bored and bored!
Oh, so, how are we doing?
Humiliating and noble!
Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating.
Y'know what, pretty good.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Well, we are great guys.
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
There's a Mr. Bing!
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Could I be more sorry.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Yeah so, Tuesday?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
That's the perfect amount!
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
That's a low one!
Okay. Four.
Welcome home man.
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Okay, hold on. Okay.
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
I've got good news!
Hey!
In the game room!
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Picturing that tree?
Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
That's... That's was...
Hi Chandler!
Couldn't be more out.
Chandler?
Hey, he's not crying.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
Well, aren't you a treat.
Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
No, Amish boy.
Can't we just use a pen?
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
No.
Wow! You look amazing!
Yeah...
Okay. I'll be right there.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Well, what did she say?
I know! I know it's awful.
Okay, that's enough honey!
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
It still doesn't work.
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
That would be advice!!
See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Stop it. Stop it!
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
I'll ask. Boohaki?
Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Okay, anything for you sir?
Iced tea.
He will, Joe.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
'S'why I'm dancing...
Don't you have to pee?
So, this isn't over?
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Stop making candy!
Hmm?
Hey, man. What's up?
Hey.
We can't accept this.
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Really? You're gonna be okay?
You should go to the game. It's okay. I want you to.
What does it say?!
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
Totally worth it!
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
We can talk about that.
I hear ya.
Good morning, everybody.
Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
Oh fresh air!
Okay.
I'll tell you at the wedding.
Who's there?
I'm not supposed to tell you.
Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
You okay there man?
Just stop it! Come on!
H-He's in China!
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
I'm free! I'm free!
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Well, I can't do it either.
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
I can't believe she's married.
Well at least we know she's a woman.
Haha, no thanks!
You can come to my house!
Aww, I love you so...
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
That sounds like fun.
Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
He has a gun!
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Its Phoebe! Hi!
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
That's-that's my nubbin.
What's that?
You know, you think I would.
Do you have a point?
No thanks, Josephine.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
No thanks, Mom!
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
I wanna quit the gym.
You wanna quit?
Ah. Chandler Bing.
Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
Yeah! You wanna come?
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
That's what I was doing too.
Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Alright, here's ten.
Fifteen.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
I made that joke up.
What?
You do? That's fantastic!
I have a badge in it.
What-what Richard thing?
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Is that a real thing?
Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
No you know I don't mind.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
She's not gonna say no.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
What about the time difference?
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Phoebe and I are moving in together.
I don't think you can do that!
Well, I'll just ask for it back!
I mean, I was sitting there.
What do you mean, your seat?
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
So, where's Mike?
Oh!
See? Here we go.
Yay!
I think I should get the chair!
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
Have you seen Joey?
Which you just gave up really quickly.
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Y'know what...
Oh, okay. Here you go.
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
...The second guy.
Which one?
That was... Impressive.
Alright. My job here is done.
Oh, I don't know, a million?
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
I'm not Jewish, so...
What?
Well it's very unsettling.
Then why are you smoking?
But, those are for you.

Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Oh, I love that guy!
You didn't just break up.
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
You gotta do it, man.
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Nice work my friend.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Thank you! Thank you!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
And you're okay with that?
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Right. So, I'm sorry...
Oh. - What's *that* like?
Okay, I gotta go to work.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
What gave me away?
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Well, this is much better.
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Okay.
We're moving to Tulsa!
What's going on?
Um, is it sugarless?
Would you like some gum?
In a bad way?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
Rachel lost Marcel.
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
We have heard you play.
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
Another hard 8.
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Courtside? Oh my God.
No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . . courtside!
And twenty-five it is.
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Are you okay?
Well, thank you for lunch.
We'll see.
This is not going to work.
Look!
Okay, then get the lobster!
I know!!
Well this is just sad!
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
I'm over here big guy.
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Oh, what the hell is that?
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
How far outside?
So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Where you going, Joe?
I am, yes.
Look, are you gonna be ok?
That's who.
Hi Joey's sisters!
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Are you really that busy?
Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
On every word?
Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!
Yeah, let's just forget it.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Yes. Right where?
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
It's a sock bunny.
Okay.
Is it really that bad?
Help me! This hurts!
You still want that baby?
But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
For three years?
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Well this one's for you.
How come you have two?
So, what're you gonna do?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Hi! How'd it go?
Hey.
Why would I be mad?
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
She's one of us now.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
It happened in London.
How?! When?!
Hey, this is so unfair!
It's worse than the thumb!
I spelled out boobies.
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
Ah that's a cantelope.
What happened to the foosball?
That was pretty 007.
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Your cappucino sir.
Hard to say.
And to you too, Helen.
Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Yeah, check out the ring.
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Well yeah, but then...
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
And your friend Phoebe?
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
So it did go well.
Totally!
Oh, do you not want to?
Really?
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
What am I gonna do now?
Damn it!
Hi, Paul, is it?
Hello, Paul.
Jumping on the bed?
From?
Wait, we can't do this.
Hee hee!
All right, bye-bye now!
All right!
Coffee in a fight!
I thought you could use the help.
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
This is what I want to do.
Really? I don't really feel like it.
So, you busy Thursday?
Thanks!
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
She? It's a girl?
Here she comes!
Joey, no means no!
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
So how you two gettin' along?
I'm not arguing with that.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
And a date with a man!
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
He saw a therapist?
Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
You mean like, music?
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Why did I get married?!
Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
All right. Very good.
No.
Um-mm, yeah right!
Is it the Italian guy?
Oh, seriously you want him?
No, seriously.
Ooh! That's my girl!
Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
Can we start over?
Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
This vacation sucks!!
Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Hey! How's the boat?!
Ahoy!
Lose the other guys.
Whaddyou mean?
I will explain it to her.
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
Mine was a humdinger.
Yeah. Mine too.
What equity investments?
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Forget it, that's off.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Did I not mention that?
You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Yes, but for the last time.
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
We're taking a break!
Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
Yeah, Ross is here so...
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
What's wah-pah?
Hey, I've been honing!
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Because that would be crazy?
No, not the used wax.
Do you know what just happened?
What?! What are you doing?!
Did you know this about him?
Hell, yeah!
All right, let me in.
That's right baby.
Happy New Year!
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Who are those people?
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
So what does this mean?
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
Yeah, he came up...
No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Seriously, answer faster!
Sex!
Joey's a sex addict.
Thank you!
Hi, oh hi.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Not it! Damn it!
Not it!
I'm the ruptured spleen.
What?!
Ohh, that's a good one.
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Ahh, third base.
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
I know, what are we gonna do?
I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
So what are you going to do?
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
When'd you meet her?
Yeah!
I also said, "Yes!"
Dude you said, "No!"
That's patio furniture!
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
Today is the sixth.
Yeah.
What is the matter with you?
Oh my God! Joey!
I can't believe you came back.
Hi.
I can check that for ya.
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
They have the best stuff in there.
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Of course it was!
Yes!
Phoebe knows about us!
Yeah?
Nope, not under here!
Emily?!
Because it's too delicious.
Why, why not?
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
Oh, great. This is just...
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Your sister Ursula.
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
Come on guys, PUSH!
Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Totally crazy stupid.
Stupid.
See you later Mon.
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Unfortunately that is correct.
Viva Las Gaygas!
OK, let's do it. What?
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
Oh no, no, no, no.
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Stick to your side!
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Okay, what do you guys think?
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
You are really frightening me.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Does anybody know me?!
You're not a lefty?
What's the matter honey?
Oww!
What's up with the simian?
You know, you think I would.
Rachel, wait, wait.
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Okay, one thing at a time.
Ohh.
Ooh, you almost had it.
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
I'm sorry, I won't be here.
I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Do you want me to call?
I will.
He really is a chameleon.
And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Yeah! Come on!
Oh yeah, that looks good.
Okay.
Me? No. You?
So, here we are. Nervous?
Uhh. You are welcome.
Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
Okay, so he's out of here.
Uh fellas,
Well, I feel like a snack!
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Meet me in the bathroom.
How do you feel about that?
Adoption.
The comedian? USO?!
Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.
You're welcome, sweetheart.
But... you suck!
We already knew that!
Hey!
What is wrong with Emma?
Thank you.
'Cause I was sitting there.
How is this your seat?
What happened? What happened?!
He's doin' some thinkin'!
Okay, good luck with that.
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
I can't believe I ruined this.
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
That is a bad interview.
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Oh, okay, time's up!
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
How could it not matter?!
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
This can not be happening!
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.
So are we...friends again?
No problem.
Actually, I don't like martinis.
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
I don't know, I'm very tired.
Is that supposed to be an insult?
All right, rock on.
Great. I'll ah, see ya then.
Staying out of the way.
What is your job?
And last but not least.
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
I'm a pretty little girl.
And?... AND?
It's me. I'm the other guy.
Who?
An old cookie?
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
Let's have Monica decide.
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
They'll never understand!
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
Look, maybe we should go?
That's what I said.
It's an old key!
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
It doesn't scare me!
You probably want us to move in together?
Let me try it on!
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
What are you doing out there?
Oh, yeah, I do.
Bullies, big bullies.
Cannot feel my tounge.
Did she freak out?
Well, she saw the ring.
Oh, you'll see my friend.
What are you doing?
Oh uh, o, OK.
Oh that's me, I gotta go.
Yes, it's also 2003.
No, it's not.
So, uh, how was he?
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
Really? Male nurses?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Oh good!
Work on your music?
this summer?
We could trade later.
Alright, let's see..
Hey, you feelin' better?
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
Hey. Where've you been?
Hey.
We're very happy for you.
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
I see where you're goin'!
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
I don't... uh... understand.
Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Again, it's not that he...
How long was I in there?
Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
I wanna quit the bank!
Hi, I'm Karen.
Do we pay for this?
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Cool, girl roommate.
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
Whoa! Don't know about that.
You are ready to make a commitment!
Do you have any ideas?
Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
Hey, you must be Owen.
Can I adopt you?
I'll cancel the sodas.
What if we have to pee?
Hello! Little ones.
Oh, you're such a cheater!
So- you can tell?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Okay!
So, are we going in there?
My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
I'm so sorry you're sick.
Ohh!
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
They're gonna do it together.
It's throwing and catching!
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Now that Rachel's gone?
Thank you!
You wanna hug it out?
Okay!
Well where did she go?
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Y'know I think you can take her.
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Lick away my man.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Am I naked again?!
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Can I just say one thing?
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
God that is good TV.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Batman has the Batmobile!
007 has a fancy car!
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Hi!
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Hi.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Okay, bye!
He took my essence!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
I think you should take the job.
Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
So what was it for anyway?
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Alright, so what's it about?
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
No, no, no. No-no-no.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
So, I guess this is over.
Yeah, it did.
With extra pulp?
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Woah, hey, yo.
Hey you.
Can I use your phone?
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
I think it just fell off.
Please... go! Just let me know if you need a hand!
Your tax dollars?
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
You slept with the stripper?
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
Oh, this is soo bad.
I am!
Well, Joey's my best friend.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Great!
He's the boss's son.
Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Heh, what d'ya say?
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Which smells delicious!
That's my pie!
Yeah, well, lucky for you.
You didn't even take off your pants.
Always illegal Joe.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Probably around gonorrhea.
Hey man, what's up?
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
That's kinda nice.
I can't smell your sandwich?
Did I say you could smell it?!
All right! Let's do it!
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
What?!
My lighter's in there!
What's going on?
Wait, wait, wait.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
What did I marry into?
Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
What are you doing?!
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
Hey there you are!
You have to really wanna see it.
How is that the silver lining?
They put you in jail?
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
I can't believe we're doing this.
C'mon.
It's the Miracle Wax.
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
The British are coming?
Hey you guys, guess what?
Well, either that or uh...
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Aah, y'killing me!
Nice shoes, huh?
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
I can't remember which sister.
What is the worse part?
And that doesn't scare you?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Oh you knew that. Good!
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
There's nobody here Joe.
Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
You know...Oh My God.
What's up?
Don't read my condoms!
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Let them win one.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Did I go to this school?
He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
Okay, the last thing...
No, no, no, no, no!
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
OK, Pheebs, your turn.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Football? Just football?
Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
Not 700 exactly?
Uh, wow, 700.
Oh, are we playing this?!
It's your turn.
I'll give up my ticket.
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
I - I don't think I can.
So, let's do this.
Because, I'm too afraid.
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
He's Greek Orthodox.
I am Father Kalebasous.
Okay, come here! Come here.
Sure! Okay, you go first.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Yeah, you do.
Why? What happened to him?
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Let me see the earrings.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Hmmm, that's very cool.
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
What, what's what you mean?
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
So that's the girl you like.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
It's not charity, Joe...
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
You mean a three pointer?
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
It's okay, I got a plan.
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
But we don't know the neighbors.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
No, no, you don't have to see.
What? Let me see.
That's not a state Joe.
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Hey, don't we have to...
He's at a dinner party.
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
I got you something from Vermont!
Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. Joey: Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! Closing credits.
I did! I absolutely did!
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
So, a professor, uh?
Ok.
You just thought of that in there?
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Could you want her more?
What?
I said art lover.
What'd you say?
What is so funny about that?
Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
Do I still call you Ross?
Nope.
I can't believe we live here!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Oh no! No! No! No!
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
What are you guys talking about?
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Oh, don't worry about it.
So--You got in voluntarily?!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
I don't know. What do you think?
So? Do you think we should get it?
Okay, on three. One....Two....
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
I know, this is a great apartment.
Can you believe this place?
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
Because she's your lobster.
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Isn't she cute? No!
I'm the student.
Can I uh see something?
There's my little boy.
Let's do it, come on!
Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
You guys wanna eat here?
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
Isn't that Ross's money?
You wanna eat? My treat!
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
Hi! How are you?
Monica. Calm, self.
Everyone. Erica, baby!
Your thoughts? Plural?
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
I see you later! end.
No, I just had to get a picture of this.
At a fake game!!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
What?! Why did you do that?
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
New York is awesome!
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
Umm, Gene.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
I'll take her back tomorrow.
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Where's your baby?
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Hello!
Water! Water! Water!
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
It's gotta be the first one.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Actually it's both of us.
With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
Joey you broke my chair!!
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
That's a good call. Right.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
Well, I have a call in about that.
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
A little late for that.
aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
What?! What-what is it?!
I can't believe we're living here!
Hey, what you guys talking about?
You know, ah, I've been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it's not my fault. It's a natural instinct.
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Tell it again. Seriously.
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
No, I ah, I didn't do them.
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
Now, there's two reasons.
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
Thanks.
I know what she's talking about.
Excuse me?
You don't even have a car!
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
Well, we could count again.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Oh yeah! With who?
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Yeah, let's celebrate life!
D'you want to?
And that's how you bought it?
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
You, you are gonna love this.
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Happy birthday, pal!
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Thank you.
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Not if I kiss you first.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Hey! Happy birthday ...
Hey you guys!
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Ok, this could be tough.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Boys? We're going in.
I just... can't do it.
Somebody is gonna pick us.
You don't know that.
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
You burn your mouth?
I think we proved our point.
Phoebe is, making people.
I know. Ross is getting married.
Sounds like a date to me.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Oh, what a crappy night!
Just us.
No, not us... Us!
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Should we call the spitter?
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
This took you all day?!
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
Uh, if you say so sir.
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
She has a real name.
Nana?
I'll catch you guys later.
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
I don't care! I don't care!!
Honey, honey, people are looking.
I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
What am I gonna do, huh?
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
Well the duck can swim.
What about the duck?
Put Joey on the phone.
I have no idea what you just said.
Oh o-, OK man.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
Merry Christmas, you guys!
Merry Christmas.
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
What? What do you mean you know?
Yeah, I know.
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Come on! Do something!
I'm not gonna mess it up.
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
Could've been a peach.
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
How about Joey... Pepponi?
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
God that is good TV.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Isn't Ben in this?
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
How's your room Rach?
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
And the bunny got away.
Sorry.
Man, I am so beat.
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Your boyfriend is so cool.
So'd you guys have fun?
But you're still my friend?
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Really?! You promise?
Ok, ok, here we go.
Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
Borrow money from me?
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
I never stopped loving you.
Huh?
Okay, who wore those?
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Ok, you can not do this to me.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Oh, how well you know me...
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
I'm not getting into this again!
He took my snack!
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
London baby!!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
How do you know that? How?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
...And what did you bring?
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
But I think we should tell her.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Ring dammit, ring!
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
You're shooting with Althea?!
I took a shot.
Takin' that with you, huh?
It's really not that big!
It's exactly like it sounds.
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
So who's gonna tell them?
We sure are.
This is going in your book?
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Don't play with his things.
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
Ok, how about this ?
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
I believe I read that somewhere!
I have sex with dinosaurs??
The reason he just said.
Why should I help you?!
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Her name is Erica.
This is a boy, and that's a girl.
To pay for the gym.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
What did you guys just do?!
Okay.
I don't have travel insurance.
Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
How can you be so confident?
It's OK!
No. No. I don't think so.
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
Oh! It's on! It's on!
Oh my God!
I can't believe it! We're here!
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
The man's got a point.
That's true.
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
All right, then massage me up right nice!
OH MY GOD!!!
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
That, that's what's stupid.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Hey!
Well maybe he was nervous.
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
So uh, what are you in for?
No, please.
Take off your shirt!
Stick out your tongue.
I want you to say that you like her!
Look, what do you want me to say?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Definitely!
Man, I gotta get a kid.
You have a play date with a stripper?!
Is that your new walk?
Let's go.
I said it first, bro.
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Oh, great!
I never want to leave you again!
Got ya.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
What about that circled one?
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
That's what they'll call us.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
What stupid thing did you do?
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Hi honey I'm home!
This is Vicrum.
Your hands are shaking.
Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Sounds like a fun party.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Beam me up Jesus.
What does the sign say?
He thought you said gonad.
What?
I mean, you have a lovely home.
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
What?
That was there when I got here.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
It's like a giant hug.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
She's just doing her job!
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
You can't move at all?
Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
And, a lemon lime.
You got me a cola drink?
Okay, we owe you a present.
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
There we go little fella.
Oh! It's on! It's on!
Those are all really old!
Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
Can I finish my story?!
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Hey Joe what's up?
Hey you guys.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
All right, I got 48.
What-what 'cha doin'?
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
Did she go out with him?
No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
No not Candy Lady.
Candy Lady?
Can you people not see me?!
Yeah. Sure.
What if Joey were president?
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Way to be cool, man.
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
That's not specific to girls.
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
I paid for those tickets!
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
Good! That's good!
Dude that is so sad.
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
So are you gonna...talk to her?
Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
We've got to do something!
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
I said, "Like what?"
What-what-what is so funny?
Why haven't you told them?!
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Oh, good. Rog is here.
C'mon up.
You have to pick your moments.
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
By drowning or...?!
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Yes have you seen any?
A monkey.
Oh, the tears are real.
You're fake laughing too, right?
Is there a puppy here?
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Well, how you died was funny.
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
So, is Janine around?
Sure, neighbor come on in.
Well that's a full cup!
No. Why?
It was a car backfire!
My God, Joey!
You are so great! I love you!
I bet this will work!
You can't make this stuff up!
Bert and Ernie!
Pretty good! I told her.
Well, howdya feel?
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Oh they didn't want to come!
Where were your parents?
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
So, did you do it?
Did you not understand the story?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
Let go!
Is anybody else scared?
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Oh, we could do this all day.
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Your liking it, huh?
These little women. Wow!
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
And why not?!
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
No, no, this is the first time.
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
What are you guys doing together?
Hey!
Pie eating contest?
God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
You're naked in this picture!
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Have fun at church-camp!
Okay.
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Chandler, is that...
Ah, finally an explanation.
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Oh, that was my work laugh.
That noise you just made?
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
You mean the lully story?
Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
What about the obsessive cleaning?
Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
I thought your time ran out.
Yeah?
This, this actually is a...
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
God, I love these fingers...
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
I got it! Scotch... tape.
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
Althea?! What are you doing?!
Althea!
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Okay.
Oh, so that's what this is for.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
She said she'd call me.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Who the hell is Carl?!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
So, we gettin' a fish?
Bye.
Well you proved them wrong.
I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Well, you're amazing.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Man, she is really gullible.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
I'm afraid I might just be.
Are you the cutest?
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
And was the curse lifted?
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Chandler.
All right, I'll pick that one.
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Sorry about the table, man.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
But, I never left the room!
But, you got up!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
It is so good to see you!
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
You're definitely scaring here.
There you go!
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Ow!
Oh come on you big faker!
Not now, I'm sick!
Who are you going out with?
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
You gonna buy a new one?
Yeah.
Well, like father, like son.
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
So, I guess this is it.
Die Hard still great!
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
So ah, whatcha watching?
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Hey.
We are gonna be great parents.
Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
No-ot for me it doesn't.
Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Hello sir, you know Monica.
Well I'm peeking. Oh my God!
Okay, look, just do it gently.
Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Hey, big guy, game time.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
You can't just call Monica's room.
I call Monica's room!
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
They're still just friends, right?
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Well, I, I should go in there.
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Uh, could you leave me one?
Ah.
So whaddya got there Monica?
She told us.
Joey, wait! The ball!
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Okay, here is the phone bill.
Ahhh.
Not once did we do that.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
GET OUT NOW!!
Yeah.
No, did he hug you?!
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
So excited about your letter!
Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
What've you been up to?
Bob here.
I can't seem to say goodbye.
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
I always liked you, Ken.
I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Yes that was a nice place!
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Oh, is that against the rules?
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
Stay out of my freezer!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
I'm not breaking up with her!
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
You're a little high maintenance.
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Whoa, snowing out there?
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Should we do something?
What the hell is going on?!
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Eh!
I've got canned goods.
Ennnh.
The wife says "Hi!".
Blah blargah, blar-blab.
You hear that? We're the guys.
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
From here to the airport?
So you're really okay with this?
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
I'm sure you're right, but why?
You idiot!!
And no kissing your neck.
Huh, and no cuddling.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
You know that's not the reason Joe.
Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!
Me! On my computer.
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Where's my seat belt?
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Don't you love the huge yard?
You're turning into a women.
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
I didn't know Monica had these!
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
Game's tomorrow night Joe.
Where are you going?
Oh no, you'll have to come.
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
How was your date with Joey?
oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
There you go! There you are!
I-Ohh!
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Yeah.
Really? Like you have a routine?
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
What are you guys doing out here?
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Yes! Rent!
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Uh, yes, yes it is.
Uh, is your name Chandler?
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Are you intrigued?
Well, those were seals, man.
Yeah.
Two hours, that lasted!
No he doesn't!
Right. So how're you doing?
Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
No! No! Not, Paris.
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
But honey you don't have to.
About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
I-I-I don't know.
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Mailbox.
Glass, sand, whatever.
What?!
WHAT IS IT?!
Yeah! Right!
I'm gettin' my chair back!
Noo! Angels.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Well, so why not go knock?
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Doctor Connelly just called.
Hey sweetie.
It was a "Wendy's!! "
What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
I can't believe the guys missed this.
Excellent, that was excellent.
Ooh! Calm down ...
I don't know, probably just invest it.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Whoa.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Here we go, here we go.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Well, what did the police say?
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
Chandler's a girl!
What... did you get me there?
What?
Love your condoms my man.
Hi!
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
She's there?!
Seriously, where did this happen?
Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
And this- is my reward!
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
She was not good. Not good.
Awful! Horrible!
You're not gonna need my help?
Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
He started mine first!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Hmm, the game's at one.
Did I do something to you?
Why are you wearing my apron?
Hey.
So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
I'm gonna put on some music.
So do I.
They're never coming down now.
Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... Goodbye Chandler Bing.
Can I sleep on your couch?
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
And then Joey remembered something.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Our guy smells incredible.
My guy has great teeth!
You said that to me last week.
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
Wow! Just like in the pros.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Why is your family Ross?!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Well then why can't I see it?
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
You know, I think I might just.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
Okay.
I know, but just let me say it.
Oh my God!
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Hey, do we do this too much?
But then later that night...
Oh.
Ooh, let me talk to him!
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
That is the exact same thing.
Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Oh my God, introduce us!
Oh my God, Rachel!
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
We're teeth people Zack!
Yess!!
Wow! Look at them run.
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
There are seven?! That's one?
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Well, only if you order stuff.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Could there be more Kims?
With such a sad history.
I know! You ready to trade?
Oh, look at these little bunnies!
I'm not even... I'm not even...
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
Huh.
Youre not gonna lose him.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Ohio!! Thank you!
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Oh...
Kori? Kori Weston?
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Mm! Night Gar'!
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
I didn't know you had another level.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
When did that happen to you?!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
What?
Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
Okay, let's find these birds.
Just put it on a plate and leave.
I thought I had to make the jokes!
You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...
Hello! One marriage please!
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Janice is gonna go away now.
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
I have not been sick in over three years!
I don't know... um, Grease?
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Oh, just do it!!
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
We don't need to remedy that.
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
That was pretty intense huh?
Come on.
oh yes, God yes!!
Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
But are you sure you can do this?
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Bye. Are you still out there?
Okay. Bye.
Kinda. They're really big.
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
All right.
I do NOT want this unit!!
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
No freakshow, she's fictional.
Really?
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Paid your phone bill?
Sure.
I was not ready for this today!
Thank you so much for that gift!
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
That new mountain bike?
No.
What is the matter with you ?!?
Ohh, I love birds.
I know. He has your eyes.
Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
Quick! What time is it?!
No!
mmm That's enough about you!
Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....
The one time they're not home.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
As crazy as soccer?
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Stop talkin' to your men.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Might wanna try Joseph.
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Why am I hearing cheering?
All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...
What!? Of course I did!
You didn't watch the tape.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Bye-bye.
We're not gonna lose to girls.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
You left a shoe here?!
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
...and then it got canceled.
Oh, it looks great!
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
What?
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
What?! Why does she think that?
No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
Can I give you a present now?
Aww! I love you!
I did pay for half of it.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Joey, I saw you push him!
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Joey was in a porno movie.
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Well then maybe you should take it.
Well that's how I feel.
Hey, you said that without gagging!
Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Do you have my credit card?
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
Well it's not Sean Penn.
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
Ha! I'm just messing with you.
What?
And the Knicks rule all.
Huh.
You did look like an idiot.
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
They got a breakfast buffet.
It's 9:30 in the morning!
: I thought we had them!
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
I'd love it if you would do it.
Really? I can do it?
But I love swing music!
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
You totally screwed him over.
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
I quit and you learn what I do?
No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
All right buddy, way to go!
Yes!!
Oh, well... Maybe we could...
Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
I got the time to get to know Julie.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Wow, he looks so normal.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
So you didn't mean any of that?!
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Hi.
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Your work makes me sad.
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Well, she... she didn't win...
*What*??
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
There's no back to this couch!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Ross' shirt is torn.
Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
No. How are ya Paul?
Rachel?
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
Well, it still has to go, right?
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
How about those three pointers?
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...
Really? What changed your mind?
Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
See, I told you they don't swim.
Sure.
No, we only went out once.
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
There's a hair in my coffee.
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Who?
No! No! No! I can't do that!
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
So what job did you get Joe?
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
How did the job stuff go?
Should we send something?
Lets not do that any more.
Yeah.
God!! What am I gonna do?!
I remember you did.
All right, call it in the air.
You got a better idea?
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Okay, let's play my game now.
Ahh, his work is done.
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
And I just want a million dollars!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
No.
You mean you didn't get it from this?
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Okay. Okay. Ace!
Yeah! All right! You go first.
Yeah?
All right, maybe I should call her.
No, sorry.
And I think Ross is generous too.
Okay that's so generous!
I love you. And I know about the baby.
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
Yes, and that's why we're here.
They're in my bag over there.
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
How did you? How? How?
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Ah! The high road...
No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Sorry.
That's what our friends call us.
So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
Our next cocktail party?
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
How about you?
Okay, but now see you're crying!
See? It's no big deal.
No! We're not borrowing money.
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Yes, you can pass for 19.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
Oh my God, I'm late.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
It was you, pal.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Hi, Monica.
Please tell me you got the message!
Hey!
You know how to use a compass?
Huh?
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
How'd it go?
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Kill me. Kill me now.
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Your last roommate's kidney?
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
Who said anything about Christmas?
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Guys guys, check this out.
Hey nice boobs.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
One.
What we did last night was....
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
So uhh, how's the palace?
Hey.
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
My friend's name is Joey.
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
Well, did-did you correct him?
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
I got you a present!
Man, didn't she like just get here?
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
I don't know. Should we try it?
Are you sure?
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Would you stop staring at her?
Wow umm, calm down.
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
There you go! Someone came!
It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Do either of you have the keys?
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Hey, what's goin' on?
The man is showing brain.
What?!
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Hi!
Man, that's some bad advice!
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
I know. Gooooood luck with it.
Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
What's going on?
Can you ever feel your ears?
Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
No.
That's great. Can I see the book?
I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Here we go! Here we go!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
You kissed her that night too?
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
So you really OK about all this?
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
...Take off their hats!
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Our guy has great hair.
My guy is well read.
There's a forest right outside.
No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Step away from the duck.
Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
More so than anything else.
Was I talking to her about gas?
Why don't you open with a joke?
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Yes, every single one of them.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Where in Cuba?
I'm a little busy here Paul.
Would you.......Would you hug me?
Still on Amelia Earhart?
Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
What in God's name is that?!
Okay!
What do we use to split it?
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
But, we'll stay here with you.
That's cool.
No, no he went for a walk.
Hey, is Chandler here?
How is that ever going to happen?!
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
I didn't finish my five pages.
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
I'm sorry..
No one was around to hear that?
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
So uh, which one is mine?
Uh-huh.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Well...I'd better get going.
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
You mean that?
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Yeah, you didn't get one.
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
What's up?
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Now you do that, you're on TV.
I can't do it!
Are those my wife's nipples?
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."
Where are Bill and Colleen?
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Frank Jr. : Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
What do we do? What do we do?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Just a little bit of sugar.
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Its still there!
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
What?!
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Hey, what did your agent say?
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
The sun is out!
I have *not* thought this through!
What do you really want to do?
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Oh my God, Richard.
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
You give me back my Walkman!
He's taking off her coat!
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
How long have we been home?
No.
Really? Right across the street?
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Well you did pull his hair.
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Rachel used to live in that room.
Rach, Rach, knock knock.
Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
Fears and Pet Peeves.
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Sure! Where are the seats?
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
No-no, we do it every year!
Hit yourself in the tooth?
You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
Yep, yep...You?
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
How do you know so much about this?
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
I'm him.
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Let me see! Show them!
We're notwe're not saying anything.
Shut up!
I know, I still am one of these.
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
You wanna see if we still have it?
Yeah.
I think we've found our sperm!
Ok.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Hi.
You want me to wear your panties?
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
Here it is! Here it is!
All right!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Because the kids need new shoes.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
You, touching yourself, out!
Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
You do realise that's your brother?
Bedsprings, unmistakable!
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Then all your stuff would be here.
Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
So where are you applying to?
Oh, what a line.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Well it's not flexed right now!
This bicep?
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Oh hi!
It's like this, me, no jokes.
Wow! What's that like?
That really was an incredible wedding.
I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
Right behind you, big guy!
We have to stop them before something happens!
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Oh my God, that's Charlie!
does what always have to be sharks.
: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... Hey!
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
We have to get out of here, baby!
He isn't?!
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Oh, hi.
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Look out kids, he's coming!
All right, see you guys.
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Oh, yeah.
For an emergency just like this.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
All right.
Have you ever been with a woman?
Well that sounds fun too.
Did somebody sign your bra?
No!
...little playthings with yarn?
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
No you didn't!
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
You look cute in bubbles.
Weird world. Your kids?
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
You are a frightening, frightening man.
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
Bye.
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Yeah let's head off to work.
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Okay! See you later!
Joey, why is your cable out?
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
It's hard for some people!
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
And it works both ways.
Would you please get some rest!
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
No! No! No! I was so careful!
Yeah she said something about crumbies.
The food there was, was great.
It was, wasn't it?
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Chandler!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Night, you guys.
Your family name is Tribbiani.
Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Soo... you girls having fun?
That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
I'm Monica.
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
What?
We don't have to come up with this now.
Totally!
What am I supposed to do with these?
I give you $ 500 for them!
I hope she throws up on you.
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
You still can't stand her can you?
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
No... It's all glued together.
Okay.
This is the New York Times.
Can I see the comics?
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Oh.
Yes, include more people in this.
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
No, we'd just like to close them.
No-no.
That's easy, baggage claim.
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
This is Janice.
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
And now you're giving me the message!
So uh, Emily called last night...
We have free porn here!!!
Yeah!!
That was like 5 years ago.
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
I found a dried up seashores.
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
So, you feel like a dad yet?
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
Last time I do that, I promise.
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
And condoms are the way to do that?
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Not even on page 7?
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
This is for the fourth grade.
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
I was not and oh God, shh!
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Yeah, they're mine.
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
London baby!
You really think that is what he meant?
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Well, where's the logic in that?!
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
All right.
Something else I might have said?
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Well?!
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Who is he?
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
So?
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
Is this because of the burrito thing?
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
Nice!
Alright I feel youger already!
Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
No, come on, you know that's not true.
Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
Basically we just feel that he's...
I dunno, there's just something about...
Did that movie ever get made?
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
Well I like both eggs equally.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
You can't leave me alone with her.
To use the bathroom.
You're building a post office?
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
He just said, "No strippers."
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Are you okay?
They got a phone in there, right?
Okay, fine.
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
You told her!
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Turn! Turn!
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
See now it feels like Christmas!
Oh, here.
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
It's just a fur ball.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
When did I try to give you money?
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
I used to have that bumper sticker.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
And that's... how... it's done!
It's like watching porn!
Honey? Leave it to the pros.
I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
Hello? Is someone on the line?
Ok, don't hold thy breath!
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
You look beautiful. Is this new?
I love you sweetheart.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
Nighty-nite.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
More coffee over here, please!
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
You mean like for award shows?
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Yes because uh, you look so young.
You thought I was Rachel?
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
Then what is it?
I could fall asleep at a play.
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Was that Emma? Is she up?
Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Are you actually saying these words?
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
Dude! How-how did you write this?
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
And there's not chance that will work?
No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
What happened?
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
And now I've picked it up again.
Yeah, so?
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Where did you hear it from before?
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
What were we thinking?
Oh so there can't be any yelling.
Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep.
It means we're holding hands.
What does she mean by HH?
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
You okay?
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Hey.
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
In a foreign, romantic country...
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
Career counselor?
Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Look, we can't stay in here forever.
Well I didn't! I didn't propose! Unless uh... Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and...it does sound like something I would do.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
I remember when we first got engaged.
Next time, can I say breathe?
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
I got something for her. It's a book!
Our place, the hall! I...
Was that place... The Sun?
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
That's very funny. We done now?
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
All right! I found one that fits!
I've had better.
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
OK, so now we draw cards.
No.
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
OK, this one right here is from me.
Well, thank you, Melanie.
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
Yeah, make that three.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
Twins actually run in my family.
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
Wow!
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Yeah he was wasn't he.
That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
A two and a five.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
I don't get this! She was horrible!
Your sister Joan is crazy.
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
We were playing poker, alright...
Thank you.
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Gooood morning!!
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
Hey.
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
You do know that Wham broke up?
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
All right! Bring it on, you...
Okay, guys.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
No, I just had to get a picture of this.
Dude, you're not tanned.
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
Yah, I think I broke my hip.
Alright I feel youger already!
You're it! Now run and hide!
What's goin' on?
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
You are so cute.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Hello? Hi.
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
How do you not fall down more?
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
You broke the pact!
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
You think we're ready for something like that?
Yeah
No, the little girl creeps me out.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Kick save and... denied.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
What is this?!
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
One of the slots got filled.
Did you get it?
Batman has a utility belt!
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
What, what are you laughing at?
We are there!
Work people? Nobody told me.
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Not a dad.
And lots of kissing your neck.
Oh good, I hate it when you do that.
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
I can't believe this Chandler!
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Hey!
Yes that would have made more sense.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Well that would help the pride thing.
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Did you tell her what we talked about?
Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Hey.
What did you do when they found out?
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
And protected them from a tornado?
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Man... I... I'm sorry.
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
What are we gonna do?
What about things that are already gold?
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
What did you say?
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
Not to mention the cold sores.
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
Then I got all needy and clingy.
That is never good.
Where are they? Where are they?
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Okay, Chandler, come on!
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Just do it.
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Are you hugging the door right now.
I love you!
Love what you've done with the place.
Hey roomies!
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
First I was afraid, I was petrified.
See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ...
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Hold on! There is something different.
NAH! I don't have another level!!
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
I thought you knew that.
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
Hi Tushie.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Hello Skidmark.
Ya know, the man's got a point.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
We are switching back, right now!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
Come on, let me see that smile.
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Could we be more white trash?
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Hey!
So we both finished our vows.
Oh that's so sweet.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.
Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
What's your news?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
Chandler?
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Oh.
Well where... Where did she go?
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
There's another carton right over there.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
They said it could be up to a year.
How long do you have to go for?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
let ME be a part of this!
: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
The key's stuck in the lock.
What are you doing?
You guys ready fore the movies?
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
You built a fort didn't ya?
Nothing.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
We have to assign heads to something.
Yes! Whew!
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
That's because I'm in front of them.
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Yay! Emily!
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
We really need to take those tests?
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
So you know this leaves us with...
That is so sweet. I love you.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Would you like some pancakes?
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
So I really never get to win anymore?
Yes!
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Why, exactly?
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
I don't know.
Alright, what have we learned so far?
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
What's the second part of your plan?
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Had the money in the wrong hand.
How did it go?
And Milton Berle has a...
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
The little jail between the doors!
You mean there's more than one of us.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Dah!!
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
What did you just say?
Ross came in forth and cried!
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
4:30.
More importantly, was I any good?
Why, why, why would you dream that?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Oh great, food with hair on it.
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Oh, I ordered mine first.
I told you I should not wear this color.
Thanks! So are you.
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Yeah.
Why to save your dignity my man.
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Yes?
Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
: It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! Classy, uh?
Awesome, the name really stands out.
Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
Oh. You mind if I join you?
For a walk.
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Yes, of course they like you!
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
There is not one hair on that head.
Okey-dokey!
Maybe you do that next time you get married!
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
I would really love it if could do both.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
So? Huh? What do you think?
That's where people make number two!!
You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
My folks.
Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
I got you...these.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
Ahhhh!!
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Hey guys.
Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Think he washed his hands?
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Horrible!
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
So, what do you think we should do?
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
I want my turkey now!
You're not even giving them a chance!
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Do we need a cake?
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. How could he leave me?!?!
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Why not?
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Stick a fork what?
Some of these look a little frayed.
I guess so...
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
If you win, we give up the birds.
Oooohh that's interesting.
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
We are. He's meeting us here.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
Of course!
Depends on what you mean by we.
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Really? To what?
What's an identical hand twin?
My identical hand twin!
I can't believe she can out run you man!
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Could you get us a couple of beers?
What's this.
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Air hole! Air hole!!
Now, we'll see.
YOU NEVER DID IT!
Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Really? In front of all this people?
Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Oh God, yeah.
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
Cool! I'll catch up!
What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Yeah.
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Woooo hoooo!!!
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Your... excuse me?
Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Me neither, y'know what-
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Hey!
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Yeah?
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Good one! Yeah.
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
What do you think?
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
Really?!
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Going out with who?
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
I think it's the dying cat parade.
What is that?
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
I'm not answering that.
Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
You okay with this?
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.
NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
I know...
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Oh my God!
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Look, look, I have elbows!
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
No-no, we do it every year!
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Oh yeah. See you guys.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
You bug me.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Ohh, I'm sorry.
Why would the baby creep me out?
You said the baby.
Alright! Just follow my lead!
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Yeah.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Have you seen your guy's body?
Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Shoot.
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
Hey!
So they're going on dates? When?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Hell is filled with people like you.
Brrrrrrr!
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
We?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Hey, what's up?
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
I talk in my sleep.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Dying people say the craziest things.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
No, it's more like a good luck.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
You were?
Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
All right fine, I pick you.
Are you trying to do a British accent?
She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
You tricked me to get me into bed?
I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
...Like, ...all of them?
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
There y'go.
That's what you say at the end of a date.
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Really?
So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
Thanks.
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Nope.
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
Hey! I got great news!
See, that's why we don't let her play.
Score! Now can we go?
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Hey!
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Well, this is just as boring in England.
Well, I like you less!
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Hey!
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
Do you have a sec?
I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Sure! What's up?
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Dude I just did something terrible.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
That-that is a good trick.
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
There's something new in the bowl.
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
He's really picky about his patients.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Yeah, losers talk!
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
You take your time.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
What?! You kissed!
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Mine.
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
We should always always break up together.
It's like a gift.
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Oh, now I have to go!!
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
I don't know!
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
My mom will.
Don't judge me, I'm only human!
Hey dude, what's up?
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
We don't know what could make this go away.
Oh no-no-no-no!
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
He took my joke, he took it.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Hi Chandler!
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Is this a service you're providing me?
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But my apartment!
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Oh! Okay! Phew!
You gotta let me slam the door!
Chandler-
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I wish I had smoked for my career...
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
Why, why would you open it?
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
But, you left the chair area.
I think we may have really done it this time.
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
There's no dog in here.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Guess who's back in show business.
Hey.
I am proud of all my friends today.
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
What is the big deal?
Joey said that you're in here with another man.
What are you saying?
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
That guy's going home with a note!
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Seriously? She actually said that?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
What?
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Call her! Call her now!
David, I'm pretending to read here!!
How do you think I should propose?
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
Well, I just lost my erection.
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Why do I have to decide?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
The young hot ball and chain.
Old?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Yes?
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Do you really find this attractive on him?
AH YEAAAAH!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
Which technically now you should give back!
He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Oh!
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
And you're our age. You're our age.
So, you're like a zillionaire?
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
It's not the time Charlie.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Oh, that is so sick.
Those were like the best seats ever.
It was.
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Ahh!
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Now she's passed.
Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
We could climb Mt. Everest!
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Oh my God!
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
I came over here to tell you guys.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Okay. I love you so much.
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Hey!
How long you been waitin' to say that?
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
I know, I hate being left out of things.
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Your mom was arrested?
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
What's goin' on?
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
Yeah!
You can be the best man when I get married.
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
It is starting to get dark out there.
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Chandler.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Okay.
Oh dear God, there's two of them!
Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
Hey guys.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Yeah, I gotta go.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
You really think this is okay?
Of course I will call you. I love you.
Promise to call me when you land.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
You put your fist through the wall?
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Ginger.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
Oh Chandler, stop talking!
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
Chandler.
Who jumps at loud noises!
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Chandler?
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Dude!
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
OH!
Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me.
Chandler, that's great!
It's not a real game! I made it up!
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Pecan sandy, just made em.
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Oh my God!
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
I do. I do. I do.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
He loves you.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
No-no, she really is sick!
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Well...
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
What is that?
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
What?
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
Do not speak ill of the dead.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Yeah!
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
And yet I never run into Beyonce!
What a small world!
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
And you're cute too.
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Give him money? It was a joke!
You need to give him money.
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
You got waaaay too much free time.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
What are you doing?
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
And that's the only colour that comes in.
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
I said name one!
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
I'm sorry too.
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
What are you doing here?
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Oh my God!
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
No, no! We made this decision together.
That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Fat?!
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Whazzup??
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
I love you.
You have no trouble telling time now right?
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
...And then he burst into flames.
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
I know! I can't wait!
You may wanna get some more of those too.
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
Noo! Nothing!
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Oh my God! I didn't feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon.
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
What?
To the left, to the left- aww!
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
Two days ago.
O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Yeah.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
What?
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Okay!
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
That's fine!
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
I've got five bucks says you can't.
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Come on, it's fun!
Or facing a bitch of a commute.
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
All right. Well, I'll check the guest room.
Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Ok. First of all, this is green!
All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my pictures.
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Hey.
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
I know!!
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
Yeah.
If it helps, I could slide over.
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
So what did you do today?
We are NOT signing those papers.
You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.
It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Tulsa, Oklahoma!
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Oh damn, I hate that.
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
Joey!!!
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
No... he killed his father with a shovel. But other than that, he's a great guy.
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Oh. What do you do?
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
OK. Brake left, gas right?
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Only here.
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Fine! Get out!
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Ow!
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
And I also got... two more apples.
Nice, put it with the others.
Here, pass these, will ya..
Thank you.
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
So, how many have you sold so far?
Oh God!
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
What are you talking about?
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Okay!
Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
Why not? It's brilliant! Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Good. What made you change your mind?
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Well?
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Yeah, it was really hard.
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
And that's every month?
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Yeah, okay. Alright.
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Well, they're not mine!
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
Your company has a fine foods division?
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Monica! Chandler!
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Of course!
Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Hi...
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Well, call me if you change your mind.
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Ok!
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Congratulations!
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
He's retiling my floor.
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Bodington's! Woohoo!
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Morning.
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Are you interested in this ring?!
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Hi.
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Yeah!
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
What?!
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
How did you know?
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
All right, here's the ring.
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
Ross they're really, really, really white.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
Nooo!!
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
How ya doin'?
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
Then be supportive like a guy.
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Where the hell have you been?!
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Ready?
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Yeah, I can do that.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Janice.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
What?
All right, then massage me up right nice!
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
All right, let's show them how it's done.
Yeah.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Fine by me; hope she wins.
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Chandler, why are you doing this?
I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.
Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
Look who's coming around!
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Oh, well great.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
A couple of days.
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
I look like a man??
Again I must go back to, how?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Why would I have to sleep with you?
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
Alright.
At least as long as I have the pants.
How long do you want the cuffs?
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Actually, we already found a house we love.
It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Yes!
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
Sorry!
You told us both we could be in the wedding?
I'm not supposed to tell you!
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Then free as a bird. What's up?
No, why?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Course there, they just call it food.
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Thanks, any suggestions?
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Totally. I had sex in High school...
Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
And who is this little cutie pie?
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
What?
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Okay.
Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
She's asleep.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
Yes, please!
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Yeah, right.
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
She doesn't know what to say!
What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
Great, you can cover Chandler.
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Hey, Missy...
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Arrrghh!!
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
... And where's this money coming from?
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
Break.
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Which is bad, because?
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Well, we had a little fight.
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Well, I hope you're happy!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Seven hundred bucks!
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
She was kidding about that right?
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
To be fair this one does have nuts.
Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
What?
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
We're switching rooms.
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Lifeguards.
So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Okay.
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Open up! Open up! Open up!
I KNOW!!!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Really?!
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
How you doin there squirmy?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Yeah? How'd it go?
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Come on!
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
The cold weather hurts my hip!
See all of you tomorrow.
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
Unagi. I'm always aware.
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
That's right!
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
People who've never ever been to Paris.
What? Who says that?
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
Oh yeah, let's do that!
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
How much did I love The King and I?
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
What? He's cute!
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Well I'm sorry.
I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
It's too cold.
So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
She's gone.
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
Oh my god!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
What's this?
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
How hot is this?!
Do you realize you get louder each week?
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
So there is no good time to ask that question.
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
I slept with Monica.
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Yeah.
What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Die Hard 2.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Bye.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Hi, honey.
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Why would you do that?
But you already gave all your money to charity!
Yay!
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.
Oh yeah!
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Yeah, okay.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
They're gonna call her Chandler.
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Hey!
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Uh-huh.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Wow! If only more people knew.
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Oh and you know what I want!
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Thanks, man, big help.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Uh, we might be leaving now.
: What do you need, what do you need?
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
No.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
Oh.
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
'My scones.'
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
Would anybody like more coffee?
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Thank you. Uh...
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
It was, it was her voice.
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
I tried! They won't take her back.
Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
Yes, but we have to be fast.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
The floating heads do make a good point.
Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
Bonjour, monsieur.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
Tell me about it.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
I know. He has your eyes.
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Actually, I did!
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Sorry.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
...says $30 Father; same as in town.
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
My God, you're choking! That better?
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
But she liked us.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Hey, Chandler.
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
Did someone drop the baton again?
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
I love that idea!
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Okay.
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Does seem pretty perfect.
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
Oh! Any word on casting yet?
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
It's kind of a package deal!
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Thank you!
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
It kills over one americans every year.
Oh please, hit by a blimp?
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Know when to stop.
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
She's dating. She's dating.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
How did you know about that?!
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
What's you point man?
I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
You're dying?!
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... I made it work.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Where's my granddaughter? I've been practicing my magic tricks.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
Hey.
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Okay.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Oh God! So what do we do?
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Why?
No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
We came over as soon as we saw.
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
What are you guys doing?
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Oh, well I'm uh...
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
I could get a goose!
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Oh, oh... maybe not you!
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Oh? Hello you.
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?
Listen, I think I've left something here.
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Hi Chandler.
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Yeah?
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Don't come in here!
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Hey sweetie.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Great.
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
What?
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
What are you doing?
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
300 dollars?!
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Okay.
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
007 gets all the ladies.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Hey pal.
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
Of course! It's her favorite.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Yeah.
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
What's a nubbin?
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
Yeah.
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
What, like there's a rule or something?
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Alright.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Alright open your eyes.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Look, it was a job all right?
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
What happened?
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
I really made you think about that thing uh?
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
A little what?
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Oh, really.
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Yes, is that okay?
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Hey!
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
You got a problem with that?
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
You got it.
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
What are you doing here?
Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
My fish, Buddy.
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
Hi.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
I'm fine, thanks.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Great!
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
Oh, good.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
You were gonna propose?
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Are you naked in there?
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
No you know I don't mind.
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Really, y'think so? I don't..
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Yeah.
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
No! Drums!
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Okay!
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
All right.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Uh-huh!
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
I wasn't sleeping.
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
He's kind of intense huh?
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
People are trying to sleep in here!
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Hey!
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Did not.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Okay.
Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Chandler!!
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Ohhh! Put it out!
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Thanks.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
You gave my father a lap dance!
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Well, so what does he do?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Oh, I embarrass you?
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
So? Did have sex, right?
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
Oh come on!!
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We're very proud of it.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
But I thought if you left, you get fired.
Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Is he gonna introduce us?
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Stinky?!
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
What?
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
We have a baby?
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
So? What do you think of the house?
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
What 'cha doing?
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped.
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Think it'll work?
No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!
You are to me...
You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
But we have to!
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Is that the fire alarm?
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
I'm not always that bad!
Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Oh.
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Chandler!
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
We never get smacked.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Ohh, thank you.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Or 45.
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Chandler?
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
Chandler, where are your tools?
Oooh that may be a New World's record
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
Huuh.
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
Janice? You called Janice?
I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
No.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Ok honey. that was close. -Cut to Rachel.
: I'm gonna go freshen up ok.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Yeah!
Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.
Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
No, seriously.
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
It's so good, isn't it?
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Can I help you?
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
That's great. Can I see the book?
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
I think it's insane.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Oh, okay.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Hey!
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Ross didn't scare you?
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
No, I don't.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
Chandler!!
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody said he'd be over it by now.
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Is something wrong?
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Okay!
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Fight's over!
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
On account of my rage.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.
Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
I really wanna have a baby.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Oh no.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Hello.
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Two.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
What are you doing?
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
What?
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
That's right!
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
Ohhh.
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
I can't believe you let them win!
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
You are married though.
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
She's bluffing!
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Chandler!
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
How might you be wrong?
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
What?!
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
As we all are at some point during the day.
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
No! I did!
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
Hey!
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
Ok, that's so nice.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
This is so cool!
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Hey!
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
It's kind of an important one!
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
What took you so long?
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Wow! You are really fast!
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
YEAH!
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Oh! You have a window!
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Yeah. It's actually our first official date.
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Noooo!!
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
Really?!
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Who cares? I repel women.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
Chandler Bing?
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Hey.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Yeah....
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
I am so attracted to him right now.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
I have a ring.
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
It is???
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
Well, we had a table in college.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
No, I really did forget my purse.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
I think so.
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Oh, great!
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
No! God, would you just calm down!
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Why don't you just call her?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Hey! Any good mail?
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
I went to Egypt with my dad.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
What's the matter with you?
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Yeah.
That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
All right.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Oh my god.
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
How ya feelin'?
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
All right, what about the third guy?
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Yeah.
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
All right.
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Yeah?
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Op, I like credit cards!
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Yeah.
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Great. Thanks!
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Looks good.
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Don't do what?
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Me too...
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Hey!
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Oh, no thanks.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Oh yeah.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
I know, Monica told me.
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
I did not!
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
That saves us a conversation.
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
Uh, yeah.
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
He hates to lose.
You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.
Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Can you hear anything?
Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
What?
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Love....
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
Are you mocking me?
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Chandler!!
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
I'm going to get bigger!
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Ok.
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Yeah.
She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Still doing the screening thing?
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Huh?
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Nope. We took her to lunch.
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
NO! I don't!!
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
So?
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Who?
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Ohh!!
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
Ok.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Really?
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Hey guys! What's...
Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
How?
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Okay. Will you marry me?
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Man, I've got food all over me.
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
OK.
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
That is so sweet!
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
Thank you.
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Chandler gets pedicures!
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Come on!!
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Well, I'm from California.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Hey!
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Wait. Give him a minute.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
Well, let me see.
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
You would do that? I never get picked!
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Wow.
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
Oh!
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
What's the big deal?
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Not for the next few minutes.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Yeah!!
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
You really didn't know?
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Gunther, I quit.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Right this is staging.
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Woah.
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
I don't want to say.
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
So, will I like any of these guys?
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
That can't be your father.
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
The game is over, we eat now?
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
No, forget it.
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Have you ever seen so much crap?
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
I know. Yeah.
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Crap.
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
Okay.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Can you really do that?
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
By you!?
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Nothing!
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what.
I have such fat hands!
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
What?!!
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Come on!
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Oh no, we have to!
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
We need to talk to you about something.
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!
Oh my God!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Really?
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
That's a good point.
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
I don't think so.
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Ben! Ben! Ben!
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
You grow up.
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
I almost caught that one!
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
That's a duck.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Hmm.
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
That's great.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
No, no, no, that's Dina.
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Yeah.
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
So that story doesn't make you cry?
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Yes, they can stay with us.
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
How?
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Hey, we were sitting there.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
It's not that bad.
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
He is right, isn't he?
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Hey.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Yeah.
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
What am I sitting on?
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Shh!! Wait, what?
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
No.
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
I've found....
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
So?
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
I don't do that.
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Over my dead body!
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Actually, me too.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Chandler what do you say?
Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
So what are you gonna do?
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
That's why you broke up with me?
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
What, oh my God. What did you do?
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Pretty nice?
Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
Dude, you see right thru me!!
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
How many kids were we gonna have?
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Ha!
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
It's not Rick.
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Okay!
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
They were in his office.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
And she's back in the game.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
What?
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
You couldn't do it?!
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Booo!!
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Her answer machine?
Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
You know it's twins, right?
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
My lighter's in there!
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
No, that's not exactly what I was..
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
What, uh... what juggling thing?
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
What did you just say?
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Yeah.
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Dude. You're married to my sister.
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
No, I'm not.
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Noooooooo!!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Alright boys, let's eat.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Okay.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
We?
Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
That's how old you are.
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Thanks! Let's keep going.
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
Huh, wanna bet?
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!

Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
That's worse than no food.
Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
I am famished. What do I want...
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Hey!
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Yeah.
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
No, she was definitely on my bed.
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Look, we are not gonna...
And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Was your cabin pressurised?
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
With Carol? Oh.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
See?
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Why?
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
I know.
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
The second sister dies?!
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Dude! How come you took off?
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Hi. She said yes.
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Okay.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
There is a little child inside this man!
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Huh?!
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
Answer better, answer better!
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
I guess so.
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Hey, it's Janice.
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Ok... so... Goodbye.
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
In the park?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Petrie.
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
No! That's-that's my arm!
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Okay!
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
It wasn't the best.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Oh, I...
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Great, I'll see you then.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
It's Joey's birthday.
There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
There are no tickets on the nightstand!
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Amen!
That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Hey!
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Ooh.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Well, who's voice was that?
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
My God Monica!!
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
So you were right?
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
What did it say?
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Does Joey know?
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
We make fire. Cook meat.
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
Joey, bravo!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
What?! No! It was my idea!
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Oh please!
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date...
This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Oh umm, not go.
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
And you are...
That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.
Chandler! You're home!
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Chandler.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Amen.
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
I don't like this anymore.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Wow! You are really good at this.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Maybe.
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Those are the pacts!
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
Get a room!
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
No! I balanced my checkbook.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Oh.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
Oh yeah .
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
You love me!
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
What?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Oh, me too...
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Rifts. Yeah, I know.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Thanks.....
Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
Gas? Wow! Intense.
Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! I can't, I can't hear you.
What!?
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Ah whatever!
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
You son of a bitch!
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Hang on, she's right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
Yes, I was looking for Monica.
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
I can't believe this!
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
Hey! So, did you quit?
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
Yeah.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Hey.
Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
Of course. I'll always be your dad.
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Needs some clothes altered?
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
That's very funny!
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Wha... what do you mean?
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Nancy doesn't smoke!
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Nope.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Uh-huh.
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Thank you!
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
Come on, they were not that huge.
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Why not?
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
C'mon hurry, hurry.
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Err... Kind of.
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Tah-daaah!
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Awwwww...
Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
I want a baby.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Ohh! I did not get that.
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
Canoodling?
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Oh my God! That's wild!
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Hi.
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Hello.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Okay that does sound like fun.
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Yeah.
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
Excellent!
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Really?!
That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
No, I've looked everywhere!
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
What? I get my own room?
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
They thought Joey was a child?
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Hey!
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
You're welcome!
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Waiting for candy.
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
What if he reads it in the paper?
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
That's stealing!
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
I'm gonna call after you!
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Monica!
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
There y'go, kids.
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
What?
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
What? Whoo... What?
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Yay!
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Wow.
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Why not?
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
Hi.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
What?!
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing.
Oh I'm kinda part of this.
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Now, have you told anyone else?
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
Really?
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Three!
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
No-no I heard! I'm just sorry.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Yeah.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
That's what I'm thinking.
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Ooh, so close.
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Awww!
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Would you like to call somebody?
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Wow, it's big!
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
That's him.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
And listen to this...
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
So who are you?
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Yeah!! Let's do that!
Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
You don't need a shower.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Oh, honey, the earrings...
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Come on.
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
But, I love you.
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
What?
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
I figure my character has kids.
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Hey!
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
I want a baby.
Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!
I'm gonna go.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Well, thanks.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
What?
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Whoa!
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
We could get that Everest video though.
I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
You're-you're what?!
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
Uh.. who has to die for me to get her? Commercial Break.
Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
What does she do there?
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:
Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym who am I kidding pay-per-view porn. -Cuts to Monica.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Drum roll.
Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
What's going on?
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Try the bottom one.
So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
How is that gonna happen?
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Oop!
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Hey!
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.
Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
That was a nice pep-talk.
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
What?
She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
I hate actors.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
What's up man?
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
You promised you would break up with her!
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Uh-huh.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Amazing!
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Chandler?
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Really.
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!
Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Okay, see ya later.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
College?
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Well, we certainly are alone.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
O-Okay!
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
WHOAA!!
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
No, but that's bad!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Why?
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Hey!
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Alright.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
It's an unpaid internship.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
This is so cool!
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
No. Nothing.
That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That's how I got my bad hip.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
No, but I'm gonna!
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
What's the matter?
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
"Smoke away."
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
That's impossible.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Noooooooo!
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
What are you doing?
Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
: Ok This is how much I love you.
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
Hi honey!
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
Why not?!
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
The Irish gig guy?!
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Okay, this one I like!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Are you serious?!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
You're a really good kisser.
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Thanks!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Yay!!
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Yeah?
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Hey!
Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
No.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Carol?
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Isn't there a national football league.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Oh!
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Umm, cups.
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
By all means.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Pardon?
And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
That's the door. He's gone...
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
What's up?
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
One ticket to Yemen?
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
Good night!
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
No.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
Why, what happened?
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
I don't know! But it's the same!
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Geez! Are you ready?
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
We didn't ruin it!
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
What? You really think she's hot?
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Chandler!
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
I'll...
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
You too.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
God, your hair sure is different!
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Thanks!
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
So this is your office?
Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
I don't believe this!
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
That's the rule.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
You guys ready to go?
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Hey.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Good luck!
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
Morning. We ready to go?
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
Are you awake?
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.
You said that was sexy!
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...
Don't come any closer!
Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
: really?
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Why?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Since when are you into swing music?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
Why would you kill his fish?
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Oh my God! That is so good!
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
Really?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Is he alright out there by himself?
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
You were trying to eat it!
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
Ah that's a cantelope.
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Yeah, whatever.
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
Oh, well, I can move...
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Let me see that! Oh man!
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Come here. Okay, be right back.
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
What?
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
I know! They suck!!
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
What?
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
I broke up with her.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
BEND OVER?!!!
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
No, I think we killed it.
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Hey! Good, you're home!
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like????
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
I got it! Here we go.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
You're not going to believe this!
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
Hello.
Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
I know. This is really, really huge.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Oh, So you can move them!
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Well she said she had to think things over.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
You want me to sing?
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
What?
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
So, so, what'd ya think?
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Really? Your work laugh?
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.
Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Ready!
So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Yeah, I guess.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Yeah?
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Hi!
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Are you okay?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
No?
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Have you even had a girl up here?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
No.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
At the vet.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Keep going.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
They say he's only got half a tank left.
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
No-no-no! We need something old!
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
Hey, I need your help.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
That is one good looking man!
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Get out!!
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Come on, no peeking!
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Five.
Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Hi.
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
This is the most special day of our lives.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Sure. I'll help you.
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.
Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
You knew about that?
Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
I know, it is isn't it?
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
So...
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Y'miss it?
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
Oh, thank you.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
... the WENUS?
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
No thanks, Josephine.
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Hi, can I help you?
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Bye.
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
What's the matter?!
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Okay, fine.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
What is that sparkly thing?
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Alright.
She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don't think he's ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Hey-hey, what's going on?
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
No!
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Hey. So where's Mon?
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
Man!
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
Oh, you should here me.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Well, I never call me.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
What are you doing here, Santa?
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
All right, bye-bye.
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Paris?
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Oh.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Okay, you're on.
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Hey! You're wearing pants!
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Then you go to Tokyo.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
You what? You said you liked them.
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE.
And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
You really think that'll work?
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
That's exactly what my dad used to say!
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
You have really great hair.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Seriously?
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
All right, what's going on there?
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Oh my God! What happened?
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
Here you go.
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
What's wrong?
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Oh good.
And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
THAT'S NOT ME!
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Then, I might as well ... do this . Not really sure what to do now.
Yes.
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go to your room! You're grounded"?
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.
Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
What-what are you doing?
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Well, you know.
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Does anybody want these?
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
I guess we just keep dancing.
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Eh?
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
okay, right.
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
Mon, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
What?! Noooo...
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
I don't know.
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
I'll be waiting.
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Changes?
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Why not?
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
You're smoking again?!
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
No, why?
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
Why would I eat my own arm?
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
Come on.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Hey!
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Why?
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Someone you didn't make up!
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
I brought you something.
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
But then you left.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Hey Joe!
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Go on.
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?
Why do men keep talking to me like this?
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Hey!
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
One second.
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Look, they must be stopped!
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
Okay.
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
I will not take this abuse.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, this has been fun.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
No.
Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.
Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Just those two!
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Right, okay, then no.
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Oh! Oop!
No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
What's going on?
Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
Game?
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Well, I did not know that.
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Yeah?
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
You want his yearbook?
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
Whip it out, whip it out.
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Ive never done that.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
What's she look like?
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Well, look at that, same thing.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
That's right. Did you hear something?
Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Well no, but um.
Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
What is with you?
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!
So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
Oh, no.
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Yeah baby!
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
I don't know how to play Cups.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
Yeah.
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
You really didn't have to. Wow.
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Hi.
When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
She's not here and please come in.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
All right!
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Alright.
Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
Hey Chandler.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
There he is!
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
She is so hot!
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
That word was swans.
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
Put it on.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
What?
That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
I don't know.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Karen.
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Hey!
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Something personal.
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
Each.
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise.
: is everything all right?
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
You comin'?
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
I ran!!
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
The Geller Cup.
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Umm, oh, about three months.
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
What? What?!
Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Um-hmm.
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Oh! And it gets worse!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Give me that!
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Well, apparently she does.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
How are you still single?!
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
What?
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Don't come out here!
Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
You did? How?
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Multiple orgasms!
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Because it's faster.
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
What do you say?
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Yeah?
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
Is everything okay?
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Eh, you work for that.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
You mean like, music?
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!
What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Yeah, why not?
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
IN LONDON!!!
I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
What are you gonna name the baby?
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Noo! NO!
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Hey.
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Pregnant?!
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Weren't you nine?!
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
Oh, she's still napping.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Awww. But still no.
No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it.
Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
I will go for that drink.
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Don't blame the questions!
Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...
Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
Still, he had to find out sometime.
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Yeah!
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
That was me.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Yeah, so?
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Thank you.
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
How do you feel about all this?
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
'Kay.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Gin.
Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
Okay.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
So?
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Oh! What is that? What is that?
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
I'm not your best friend?
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Yeah!
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Yeah baby! No baby!
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
Hey Joe!
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
Okay...
It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Oh, you did it!
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth.
Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Well, my nose got lonely.
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
Hey! New wallet, huh?
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Yeah. You!
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Whad'ya mean?
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
What's going on?
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
Yeah!
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Really? Who's number two?
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
You have three nipples?
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
What?!
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
That's that weird voice again.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Just pickle.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Hey, where's the chicken?
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
But the mess!
Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.
That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? Chander.
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Another lie. You have a sickness!
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Did you smoke?
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
I was frustrated with you!
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Why not?
Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Oh my god.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Did you break up with her?
Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
No! We only mess around at his place!
No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
What?!! What?
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
What message?
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Hey guys, how is it going?
We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
He's... new.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Hey. Where's Joey?
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
I say push her down the stairs.
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Oh look at you! So handsome!
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Thank you soo, much.
Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Thanks.
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Thanks for telling me!
Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
What?
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Really?
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Really?
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Oh my God. He threw up?
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Yep. Ice Capades.
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
I guess.
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
Who is Maria?
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
I know.
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
What?
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? OPENING SEQUENCE.
Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
Lovely!
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Hey.
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
You still here?
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
Are you sure?
Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
What?
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
Oh.
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
What were you thinking?
And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
I'm gonna do it.
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
What kind of changes?
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
What was that?
Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
How was your conference?
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
See? Now, he could date her.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
No.
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Wow.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
What the hell are you doing?!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Okay!
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Why?
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
Sounds like he's with someone.
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Why not?
I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
Come on, two on one.
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
It's almost our anniversary!
It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
Chandler?
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
Could ya?
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
Hey-hey listen...
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
How did you--?
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
What?
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
The fear?
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Hi, Julie.
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
What?!
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Are you okay?
Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
Oh my God!
You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
We gotta get more of that.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Yeah! Punch him!!
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
Why not?
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
Me too. I'm good at it.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Five more and I'll flash you.
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
I wasn't- I mean, I-
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.
Dude!
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
And a lot could still get in our way.
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Man, I sure miss Julie.
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
I don't understand.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Oh! It's not good.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Ohh that's sweet!
So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. Thanks!
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Oh... my...
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
No, I'll do it.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Um, thank you for the gift.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
No! No! Not, Paris.
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
So what're you going to do?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
What?
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Yeah.
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing.
I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Hey!
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
I know I love you!
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
So, who's the lucky guy?
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
Really?!
Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
I didn't know you knew about that.
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
Oh, anything yet?
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
It's a good play, isn't it?
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Oh my God, you guys!!
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
And?
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Stop it!
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Let's go watch it at your place.
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
What the hell am I supposed to do!
I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Mm-mmm.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
No.
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Hm-mm.
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Yeah!
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed.
Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
I feel...
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
He's so cute.
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
What about your breath?!
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Are you sure you're okay?
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Please!
Ok, go quick! Ross: Thank you for a delightful stay. Ross: Oh, my maple candy!
It's not the same.
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
So, so now do I get Joey?
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
What?!
Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
How could you tell her?!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
We said six!
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
You gotta take the canoe!
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Exactly!!
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Yeah, so.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
That really was some of your best work.
You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
Mhmm.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Oh boy me too!
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
What's up?
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
She wants to meet you in person.
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
You got all that from the back of her head?
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
You told her before you told us?
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
What's with him?
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Really?
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
What?
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
WOW!
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
What's the matter?
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Dude!
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Dark red.
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
Hmm.
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Right in there!
You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
It's 4:30.
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yeah!
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn.
: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Okay, break-up's still on!
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Great!
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
No.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.
Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
So, I don't have to learn what that means?
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Hey no problem.
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Good call!
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
Does it hurt?
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
There's a game?
Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad!
Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Thanks. Here's your ticket.
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Oh. Hel-lo!
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
No no no!
Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Why are your eyes so white?
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
It wasn't fun?!
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Honey, this will help.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Oh, thank you.
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Uh, sure, why not.
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
How'd you get to that?
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
Chandler, what are you talking about?
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
What?!
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
What?!
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Well, I like it. Here you go.
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
What?
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Bye!
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Good morning.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Sure. Okay.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
And you're not helping?
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. have a little surprise for you.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
No problem.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Uh-huh, yeah.
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Dude, what'd you have?
And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
Seriously, you're an intern?
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Yeah.
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
That's what it says.
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Yeah?
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
I want you right here, right now.
Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything.
What are you doing?
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
Honey why don't you go lie down.
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
Yeah, she's...
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
What?
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
It's pretty clear.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
What?!
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
No!
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
What's going on?
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Dude, what are you doing?
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
We are so gonna find them this year.
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
That's all you're basing this on?
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Chandler!
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Nah, not my game.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
You are really frightening me.
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
What?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
What are you guys doing up?
All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
You're welcome, sweetheart.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Told ya.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
How do I look?
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Then, no.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
All right.
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Thank you.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
Chandler, Chandler.
I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Ravioli's delicious!
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Okayyy!
No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
So, do you have any other question about advertising?
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
Hey.
Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
Ah. Fun conversation?
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
I know that too.
Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
What are these, like famous chickens?
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
No you did.
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
How do you figure?
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Settle what?
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
She's sleeping.
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Hi!
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Phil!
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Sounds like a date to me.
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Oh no! What's the matter?
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Oh my God!
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Anything else?
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Woo-hoo, geeek!
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
No.
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Noo.
Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
Yeah.
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Can you blame him?
Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
What? Why?
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Kinda.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
Okay, you come up with an idea.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
It's not that bad.
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Aww, man!
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
Joey!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Aw, I know all about Kip!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Oh my God!
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
My God! Is this a gym card?
I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
I had one glass.
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Well, John McLane had plans!
I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
You wanna see it?
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
No because it-it didn't seem important.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Luck!
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
...Yes?
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
Mr. Bing? Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
So are guys doing okay?
You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
I don't!
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
The Ice Capades?
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Who is that?!
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
...Yeah.
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Here, here!
Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
Oh my God! Chandler!
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
So, can I get some candy?
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.
I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Sure!
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
How did that happen?!!
Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Monica, what are you doing?
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
And she's not crazy?
That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
I decided to pee.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Why not?!
Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.
So what? Don't you have any will power?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
Really?
Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
Hey guys.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
I can't, I gotta go.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
All right, we're gonna play.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Yeah, what's that about?
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
You work with robots!!
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
You told me.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
I know!
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Bing! That's a great name.
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.
Please.. please, we are so close.
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Chandler.
But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.
Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Hey.
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Hey-hey, check out the hat!
Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
That's too much. Sorry.
That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral.
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
The big apple!
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Hey.
Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
But, ehm... you watched the tape?
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Dude, two times that happened!
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
You gotta be at least bi...
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
Don't you want to look through the rest?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Yeah. Yeah.
Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Well, I think so.
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Uh-oh.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Then why would he say it?
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Okay, good bye!
I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's.... You did you come up with that?
Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.
Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
C'mon, she's your mom!
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
What are you doing?
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
I'll get the hat.
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
What's up?
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
This couch belongs to us.
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
You remember Janice, right?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Good luck!
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
...Missy?
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
So have you called her yet?
Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Do you have any question for Erica?
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Uh-huh.
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
What are you doing?
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
What? That's like insanely easy!
Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
You're all invited to bite me!
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
How's my Bing-a-ling?
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
You got it.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
Oh really!
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Any luck?
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
Cool!
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Why?!
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
How do you feel?
So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
They're all tourists.
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Oh, that's attractive.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
No, we never do that
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Really?
Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
No.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
What?!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Some of them.
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
How did he do this?
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
Keep talking.
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Could not be more terrified.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Yeah, but don't you think....
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
Really!
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
What a phony.
"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" "Oh, thank you very much!" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
So, how was the party?
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
We should?
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Her what?
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Well you sure used a large font.
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Why not?
So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Yeah!
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Mmm.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Okay! All right, pick a half.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
He paid a lot of money for it.
You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
I don't get older. I just get better!
Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
You're really not coming back?
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Really?
You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
Then it's okaaay!
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Yeah.
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Who is being loud?
Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car.
Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Hey! You ready to go?
I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me." So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Uh-hmm.
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
You guys have such a great place here.
Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
We're all sorry...
Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
Well, there's two spots left right?
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
You guys!! Come on!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
Chandler, you're panicking!
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Susan Sarandon.
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Come on man, really how old?!
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
How would you like to pay?
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
Hello.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
No! Why does he have to go?
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
Yah.
Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
Really girls, not cool.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Oh yeah? When?
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Auntie Monica!!
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
You still on that?
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
NOW!!!!!!!!
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Oh! Wow! Hey!
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
You wanted to see me?
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
I've never wanted you more.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
No.
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
The ring is gone!
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Bumpy?
Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Ah, yeah!
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
She's mine!
Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
Honey, you don't have to do this.
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
No?
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
You too.
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
There you go!
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
Hey!
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Are you travelling with a child?
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
No, it's-it's Andrew.
Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Aww. Ohh!
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Well all right, one thing happened?
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.
Awesome!
I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!
Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Well, what did you have?
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
What?
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Well, I do.
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Honey, we gotta go!
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Hey, you know about that?!
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
What?!
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Someone in there?
Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
So is Joey around?
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Yeah, me too.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
It's work.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
I know.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
And of course, crotchless panties.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
I could be a secretary.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!
Oh, man!
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...
Oh... what does that mean?
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
So was it a lot more money?
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
I can't believe he did this.
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
And that's how it's done!
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
I am learning so much from you.
I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand.
What's going on?
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Oh my God.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Oh!
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Keep talking.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
You smoked!
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
But we love our house.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
And could I get my ring back?
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Oh-oh!
Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating.
That's great.
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
So you're not friends with him?
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
So what did you two do about it?
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Whoa! You had sex today?
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Were you the ones called the cops?!
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
I guess you're right.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
No, just give me another minute.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
And they weren't looking at you before?!
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
It's him, not it!
Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
We are even, right?
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Is Brian...?
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Never mind, it's open.
Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
What, you, you really quit your job?
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Nooooo.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
I really wish that you wouldn't.
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
And this goes for all guys?
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Chandler!
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Really?
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Thats unbelievable.
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Really?
Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!
Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
Just pass it to your boss!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Yeah, it's good.
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
Did you take that tape?
Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
My dad told me. They play golf together.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
It isn't?
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
You betcha!
Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!
Ahhh!
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Okay.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Really?
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
uhu uhu, check this out.
It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It'll probably be more than a year.
Really, you want to wait a year?
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
That had to hurt!
If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Oh, I like that. Yeah.
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
We'll see.
You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
What did you say?
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Yeah, me too.
Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
You gonna tell her?
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
What's wrong with being the Bings?
Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Hey.
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Yes, you said that.
Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
Excuse me?
They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
What are they?
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
It's a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying.
What?
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
Oh my God!!
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
You don't know?!
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Chandler!
I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
What?
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
Okay good.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Really?!
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
No! Oyster?
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job.
Manhattan.
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Oh.
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Oh?
This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.
Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
Oh, dear god!
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
And the sex?
Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
It's really starting to hurt.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
Wow! I could've died tonight.
You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Thank you?
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Give me the good stuff.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Cut!!!!!!!!!!
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Even with me?
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
I like them a lot.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
I had them made special.
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Wouldn't you be?
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
No.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Oh, howd she take it?
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Hi.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
We can't split them up!
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Hey, I thought you already had one.
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Uh-oh, it was bad?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?
Thanks.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Good-bye muscles!!
It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.
Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Come on! Chandler!
I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
It hurts my teeth.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Get out.
Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
So-so what did the doctor say?
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
What's in the bag?
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
You seen Sandy?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Him? Him, Ross?
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Oh. Sorry!
Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
What is it?
I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Yeah, you wish!
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
What was with the dishes?
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Hey.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
All right.
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Hey.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Absolutely.
Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Oh, because we love kids. Love 'em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
Are you kidding?
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
What am I going to do?
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
Nothing, huh?
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Cigarettes?!!
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
You're pretty.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Is Joey here?
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Yeah I guess you're right.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.
Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no I can't.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
It's this way? Sorry.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Has it always been purple?
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Hey!
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Hmph.
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
What?
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Everybody's doing stuff!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
You do?!
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Ohhh, here it comes.
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine." So you just touch yourself for anything?
Your eyebrows look weird.
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
Sorry, it's not.
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
You do?!
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
Excuse me?
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Oh, you forgot?
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
Okay, I freaked out a little.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Yes.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?
No!
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
Shes still here.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.
It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
No, I'm still married.
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?
How did she get me to settle down?
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, I hate this story.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Hey hey, can I help?
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
I do not have baby fever!
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Continue.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Are you sure this time?
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Wow!
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Why not?
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
I'm crying here!!
Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Hey.
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
I don't want to move again!
Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
Well, if you think it will help.
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
Cool.
Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his "business" partners.
What, what.
Maybe we finish this for him! "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Not there.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
What are you up too?
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
Don't you have to be at work?
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
I've nothing to say to you.
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
You told him he's adopted?
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Yes!
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
It does in mine!
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
My kid's in a play right now.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
You really liked it?
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Great!
So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
I lie better then that, right?
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
No... I already e-mailed her.
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
You know what the. . .
Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
Oh!!
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
No, happy for you!
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?
That's right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
Chandler?
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
Juice, I need...
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Okay, woo! Hi.
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Well, it involved Monica.
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
What?!
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Hey!
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
Yeah, where the hell is he?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
My God! What happened to you?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Oh honey...
Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
Chandler, Chandler.
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
What?
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Yeah, I know.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
How? How is your fault?
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Oh.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
Oh.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Right.
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
No.
Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.
What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huh-did you smoke?
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
I don't know you guys.
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
Okay what's up.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
The receipt.
I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Why?
Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.
Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym who am I kidding pay-per-view porn. -Cuts to Monica.
WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Really?
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
It's a pretty cool tux.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
See, now it's weird again.
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
Saw your head. Saw your head.
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
The balloon?
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Oh yay!
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Really?
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Here he is.
It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, Here's The Thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
It's "Bolero" from "10".
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You're actually going through with this?
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
What?! Anything! Anything!
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Yeah?
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
What do you mean?
Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
She needs changing.
You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....
Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's a lump.
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
So why don't you quit?
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Yes, and grumpy.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa.
Chandler, I.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
Hi.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Okay.
We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?
Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
Then you are neither of your parents!
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Oh.
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Uh-huh.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
I'll survive.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Why, nobody good?
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Oh, why is it unfair?
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
What are you saying?
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Really?
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
Ew! Gross.
A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
Your age?
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!
You fell asleep?
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
*Now* it feels like Christmas.
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Have you been here all night?
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
We want candy! We want candy now!
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Hey!
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
That only took me an hour.
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
What?
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
That's a good idea for a business!
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
That's fine.
Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
Why're you so tired?
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Okay.
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Okay.
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Chandler?
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Really?
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Do you?
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
What else did you think about?
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff.

Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
What else did you think about?
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Well then, do it better!
Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Uh huh. Why is that?
Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?
Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.
Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
The bigger half.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
