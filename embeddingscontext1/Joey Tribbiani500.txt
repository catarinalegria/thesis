But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
Joey, you have got to take this back!
No! Joey!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
I've been back and forth.
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
That's all you're basing this on?
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Oh my God!!
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
They have the best stuff in there.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Why?! What happened?!
I'm so sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Hey, I've been married 3 times
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Hey, stripper!
What?
The ring is gone!
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
Thanks.
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Hi!
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Ok.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Hey pal.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
The next, next?
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
They loved me!
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
All right.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Uh, boat rope.
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Hmm?
I think it's important that you do.
So what's your name?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Oh my... God?
So, what're you gonna do?
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Can you believe this place?
I know, this is a great apartment.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Hey.
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
He's talking to London!
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
I got fired.
Oh!
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
My mom will.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Hey!
Hey.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Why are you doing this?
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Her dancer friends?
Dude, we were good!
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
What? A brain transplant?!
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
Me too.
Yeah?
Hey!
Sh-shh-shh!
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Oh!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey...
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Oh!
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Yeah.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Still broken?
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Nah, not my game.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Okay!
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Yep!
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
What a minute, what did he say?
What?! You got us evicted!!
I told you not to go down there!
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Yeah?
What are you saying?
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Hellooo!
Hey.
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Okay, Phoebe...
Yes! Your honor?
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Oh!
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well... not in the same way...
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Hey.
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
How often do you read it?
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
But that's what...
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
You're so welcome.
Is that supposed to be me?
Yeah.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
So, there was no miracle?!
No Joe, no miracle.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
I think I should get the chair!
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Joey that is so sweet.
Hey.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
I hate this game!
OK Joey, your bet.
Ross?
Oh, I am very in.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
We owe you?!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Morning. Good morning.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Whoooaa!
That's my sister.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Pheebs, what about you?
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Okay .
Here you go.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
I'm in it.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
That's not good.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play?
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
They actually said that?
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Oh.
Yeah, no, I understand.
You do, thanks.
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
No. I'm all alone.
Daddy!!
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
MY SANDWICH?!!!
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
My God Monica!!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
That makes sense!
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Hey, that was really good!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
No, I just thought it was cute.
Ohh. Like what?
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Yeah it is. . . what?
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Who's they?
No one.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
No.
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Hi.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Thank you so much.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Hey.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Noo! Nothing!
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
So I can do it?
Yeah you can do it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Oh! My hero! What happened?
What a minute, what did he say?
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Good for you.
So... and?
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Uh-huh.
Hmm?
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!

What's wrong?
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Well did you try calling her?
Hey.
Oh!
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
I know. I know.
Feel better?
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
Exactly.
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
No.
Yeah, okay.
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Joey, why is your cable out?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
It's not charity, Joe...
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
His dancing partner?!
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Hey.
Hey.
The show?!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Hey, dude!
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
No! No! No!
They're in my bag over there.
Ah.
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's uh, right through there.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Well, what did you do?
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Okay...
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
Put it on.
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
I so am.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
I hate this thing!
Oh, hi Danny.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Well that's how I feel.
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Shhhh!
What are you shushing?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
I sort've already asked Chandler.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Hey Joey.
No, I just thought it was cute.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
...I'm his
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Well I just thought...
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Scene 5, take 1.
And Action!
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Okay.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Love what you've done with the place.
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Oh yeah!
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Yeah, that'd be cool!
Pete's breaking up with me.
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Okay.
Okay.
Not great.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Great, now he's waving back.
What kinda stuff?
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Huh? What?
It's my joke.
It's my joke.
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well... It's a date.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
No.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Not a problem.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
She's not much of a phone person.
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Come on. I want to know.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Oh that was a real person?!
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Here you go.
Thank you.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Yeah, you're on your own.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
You guys don't think I look 19?
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
God. I feel violated.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Oh.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
That's a really long time.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Good luck.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Ohhhh man
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Monica, leave him alone!
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Do you two know each other?
No. No.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Joey.
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Oh, I'm sorry what?
So...
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
Oh.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Well, I guess that's something.
Okay.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Ross! Janice?!
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Yeah right!
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
What you do mean?
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
As crazy as soccer?
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
What?
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
You don't have, anything?
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
About Ross!
Oh! Oh!
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Ohhhhh!
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
And now for the great news.
What, that wasn't the great news?
Christmas cookie?
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
My god, what happened?
Sure.
So.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
What the hell happened on that beach?!
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Thanks!
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
So Joey, you okay?
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Sorry.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
What?!
My-Oh my God!
I know! They suck!!
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Sorry!
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
She's not even cold yet!
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Is she gonna be all right?
Nice!
That's great!
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
You stink!
Are you kidding?!
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
How come you are?!
Because I cared enough to lie!
What are you talking about?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Where do you work?
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Hey! Terry.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
I can't help you Joey.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Why?
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, I don't know.
You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Y'know, about what happened with us.
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Nooo.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
That sounds fair.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Oh my.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Oh my God!
Wow!
Oh, I love that guy!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
What about my cab?
I don't need that anymore.
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
I've never done that.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Really?! You think that will work?
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Fine!
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Eh! There you go.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you're on.
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Wow.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
Um-hum.
This man is my God.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
You did look like an idiot.
Yeah that's the same.
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
Oh, who? Me?
Yeah!
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
The only problem!
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Sure! What's up?
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Do you want me to want you to care?
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Okay. Okay.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
So what are you guys out doing today?
You done?
Yeah.
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Wow!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
And tell him what?
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Great. Great.
I'll be there.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Hi!
Hi!
Great!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
You're not his godfather.
What?! Are you kidding?!
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Oh Joey!
No she hasn't.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Hey, where you been?
Score.
She is so hot!
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Great! Roomie!
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Now calm down Joey.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Not broad backed!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
So, you and Angela, huh?
Yep. Pretty much.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Yeah, kinda.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
I have a question about this scene.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
Well, that was ah...
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
I can't help you Joey.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Uh, we might be leaving now.
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Uh-huh.
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Yes!
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Are you gonna go over there?
Joey.
You look good.
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Look, what do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you like her!
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Hey, Paul!
Yeah?
Shut up, Joey!
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
Here you go.
Oh.
All the time?
All the time!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
Oh, you should here me.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
They don't have those.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Hey dude, it's me.
Hey it's Joey!
What?
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
From a bullet!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Yeah I guess you're right.
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
That's because all people are selfish.
Are you calling me selfish?!
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Hello.
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Got it! So...
So uh, do you live around here?
I'll remember that.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
She was a welder.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
It's not Christmas!
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
You bought boobs?
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Ready, Annabelle?
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
How-how did you lose your job here?
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
I am your friend.
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Hey guys.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
See you later Mon.
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Nothing?
I have to get back to...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Oh.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
What was the dream about?
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
It-it doesn't?
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
The ring is gone!
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
You slept with the stripper?
Of course!!
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Oh, yay!
Oh.
Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Oh.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Let me see that!
All right.
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Whatever.
Fine.
Phoebe!
Secret affair!
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Probably because...
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
What?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Woooo!!!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
Marry me.
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Well, do you see any babies?
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Great!! That's great!
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Good luck!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
What happened?
Why can't you tell her?
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Yeah.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Multiple orgasms!
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
So, we're having fun, right?
Yeah.
I'm kinda beat.
Actually, me too.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
As in Rosita does not move.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem?
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
We're back on.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
Ugh!!
What happened?
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Oh my.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
I'll do it.
Okay, absolutely!
All right.
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Wow. He's strict.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Hey no problem.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Welcome home man.
A little foos?
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Ok, that's Eric.
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
Yeah.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
It doesn't say that in the script.
It does in mine!
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
What?
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Monica? You're Mom.
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Oh my God! Whoah!
Well, what's the part?
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
My identical hand twin!
What's an identical hand twin?
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Hi. She said yes.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Cache? Jaunty?
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
There you go!
"...by doin' it."
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
That's great.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
All right.
All right.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Oh my God! Whoah!
Well, what's the part?
Seriously, what-what's the part?
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Thanks.
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so...
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
What?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
You're turning into a women.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
I just hope...
You can let some of them go by!
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Okay.
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Yeah.
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Did I get it?
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
"...by doin' it."
Joe?
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Can I ask you something?
Uhh, no.
No.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
What equity investments?
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Wh-what do you mean?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
OOooooo!
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
What's in it?
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
You left a shoe here?!
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Hey! So I'm back.
Who are you?
Show me in the table.
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Well, hello Rachel!
Have you really done this before?
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.

Right, I'll see you guys later...
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Okay!
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Yeah, I know!!!!
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Hey!
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Whaddya see?
You okay, kiddo?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Crazy bitch.
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Hey.
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Hey!
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Nice work my friend.
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
What? What?
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Hey!
Hey!
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
We could get that Everest video though.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Oh, well...
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Hey.
Hey, man. What's up?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Hey guys!
Hey!
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Come where?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Okay man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
I know!
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Who are you talking too?
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
What's Phase Two?
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
No I don't think so.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
And yet, we're still poking him.
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
You think I need a new walk?
What?
Are you actually saying these words?
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
No, 10 is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Okay.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Well, I guess that's something.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
No, the quiet down thing!
You mean this.
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
And why wouldn't he get it?
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon baby!
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
How is that important?
Oh it's important!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Thank you, Joey.
No-no, thank you.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
I'm not answering that.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Hi!
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
We've got a problem.
Tell me.
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
What?
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
What?! Tonight?!
That's what Monica said.
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
It's a woman.
So talk to her.
Why the voice.
Hard to say.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
I figure my character has kids.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
No! No-no-no...
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Well ah, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
What kinda things have you been saying?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I'll be waiting.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It's a curling iron.
It's clean.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Psss, that is whack!
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Wouldn't she?
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Hey there you are!
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
You realize what you are don't you?
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Please be kidding.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Then what's the problem?
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Hey, what did your agent say?
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Wow, he must like you the best.
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
No problem. Hey Chandler
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Needs some clothes altered?
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Bye Phoebe.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
I can scratch that right off.
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
What, now?
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Okay, we owe you a present.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Hey, what did your agent say?
What, forget it!
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Is all this true?
Oh Hans.
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Oh, ok.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Ok.
No.
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
What?
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
I made fun of his accent.
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
All right, you got it.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Yeah.
Y'know which one was she again?
It's gotta be the first one.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
Oh, thanks!
Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
Yeah!
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Thank you.
Okay.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
That's very nice.
That's sweet, Joey.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
I don't know, I don't know.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
You got me.
Yeah. Right.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
He's not here right now.
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
What's the matter?
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
I've never seen it!
Oh you should, it's great.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
But we don't know the neighbors.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
That's what you got me?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Joey.
Yeah?
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Well there you have it!
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Friends first? That's interesting.
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
I made them!
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
The wedding starts at six.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Okay.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
I'm sorry, what?
What?
Oh, ok.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
I can't believe she cracked your code!
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
What happened?
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
Oh my God.
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Got it!
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
I don't know.
Okay!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
That's sweet, Joey.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Well, what am I going to say?
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Great!
I can do that.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
That's right!
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Oh no!
I'm comin' out!
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
What?
Five oh dollars.
That's great.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
That's not a question.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
... It's a fertility study.
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Hey.
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Hello.
Hey!
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Chandler?
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
I do.
I do.
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
They actually said that?
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
We owe you?!
We didn't give you any money!
You don't think I know that!
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Yeah. O-okay.
How about receiving?
Yes!
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Really?
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
What?!
What's wrong with you?
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
That's right.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
All right, see ya Pheebs.
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
What?!
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
What's up?
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
That's why you broke up with me?
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
Really?! I won!
What?!
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Yeah, I remember.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
You'll vamp?!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
What was it for?
The next, next?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Well, there you go.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is there something wrong?
Joey...
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Hey, Pheebs?
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool!
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
I didn't know you had another level.
I know! Neither did I!
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Borrow money from me?
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a donut.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Okay.
Sorry.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
So what happens next?
God that is good TV.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
That-that is a good trick.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Your other student, was you!
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Where's Mary-Angela?
She's right in there.
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
Okay, fine.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
You wanna share it?
Okay!!
It's not mayonnaise!!
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Probably because...
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
Yay!!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Hey!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Your make-up!
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Oh yeah, no problem.
Thanks.
Joey!
Ross!
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
That is true.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
It might be kinda cool.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
That's the whole part?
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Hi!
So how was, how was your date?
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Hi!
Hey! Hiya!
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
So what, we just sit?
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Rachel! You okay?
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
I'm having surgery!
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
No.
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
What we did last night was....
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
Wow!
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
You think I'm hot?
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
What? Me having a job?
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Really?
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
It's not what you think, that was...
You told me I was the only one.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Didn't you sleep together?
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Okay.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
What?!
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
I see where you're goin'!
What's up with the greed Joe?
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
You or me?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
I am sorry, Chandler.
I am sorry, Ross.
This took you all day?!
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Oh, god help us.
What?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Why?
What's going on?
We all hate Emily!
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
It wasn't my decision!
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
You were in a porno?
That is wild.
So what's it shaped like?
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
What?
Cupping.
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
What? That's not? Oh my God.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
And the bunny got away.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
And I would have to say pah-huh.
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
What the hell happened?!
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
What equity investments?
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
You don't even have a car!
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Anything but stew.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
What if Joey were president?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
I did, but that was really fun.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
The Bible?!
I don't know!
Diverse.
Did anybody call for security?
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
What?! Why?!
What about the closeness?
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Hey, guys!
Hey!
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
You do, huh?
What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Ewwww!!
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Joey, you had the night!
What?
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
What are you talking about?!
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Marcel?
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Ah, finally an explanation.
Joey!
Yeah?
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Well.
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
Oh yeah.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
Joey, this is awkward part.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
No.
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
So it's okay to date a student.
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
And a date with a man!
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Isn't this great?
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Come on man, you're not a potato.
I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
Yeah!
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Hey!
Hey.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Help! Help!
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Ooh, I look good.
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
You gave her food poisoning!?
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Oh yeah!
Really?
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
That's crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
You gave her food poisoning!?
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
I have to get back to...
That's okay.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Wow.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
It's open! Come in!
Hi!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Ohh! A man with a plan!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Hey! So I'm back.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Nice work my friend.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
When did I try to give you money?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
It was a dry day.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
All right, be my guest.
Good luck.
Oh, I got it.
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
Hi.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Great!
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
So how you two gettin' along?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
There's another carton right over there.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Hey, I've been married 3 times
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
It's him, not it!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Oh man!!
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
So she's a woman! So what?
Joey!!
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
I'm sorry man.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Well when can we have this shower?
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Ohh-oh, chilling!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
I don't know you guys.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
No, I got him.
No, seriously.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Uh, Phoebe...
Oh Ross, hi.
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
That's what you should say.
What?
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Sorry.
I'm sorry Joey.
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
So...
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Don't touch him!
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
What a nice story!
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Okay.
Yeah!
Should we call the spitter?
Hey Rachel!
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Amazingly, that makes sense.
You think?
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Stay out of my freezer!
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
In a minute!!
So this is it? Victor?
So long, Vic!
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Hi!
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
As are you...
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
He took off?
Go on! Go on.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Excellent!
Uh, may I help you?
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
What the?!
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
