Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Umm, yeah! Today's.
'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Doctors are wrong all the time.
Well, yeah.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
No.
At the coffeehouse, right.
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
Why?!
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
What's in the bag?
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Phoebe, wait a minute!
I'm an assistant buyer!!
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
Bye, Pheebs!
London baby!!
Come on! Do something!
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Okay, she can't go.
Then what am I supposed to do?
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
Well, but Pheebs.
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
What's the matter?
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
Aww, good. What?
What? I'm just said.
So ah, whatcha watching?
Baywatch.
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
What?
Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.
Uh, Julie.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Alright, we have to talk.
There it is!
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
Well, this is none of my business.
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Well, that could've been really awkward.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Not if I kiss you first.
Ooh.
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
I know, the babies are asleep.
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
But my apartment!
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
You don't drink.
Oh, Urse...
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
No.
No, 'cause he's yummy.
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
You really thought it was perfect?
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know.
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
I don't....
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Hi!
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
What?!
Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
Oh my God!! Great!
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Hey!
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Uh-huh.
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Okay.
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Are you sure?
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Yeah?
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Because I'm going to London.
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
It could be like a big giant guy.
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
How do you not fall down more?
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
Yeah.
Ok, here, watch this.
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Hey Rachel?
Yeah?
Really?!
Uh-hmm.
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Well, that could've been really awkward.
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Hey!
How did we do?
I did not freak out.
Why'd you freak out?
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
I guess it could.
Well then I think that's it.
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
I can't! I have to work!
Phoebe?
Ugh!
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
He left that.
Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
What?! What are you doing?!
Do you know what just happened?
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Yeah.
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
I have no idea.
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
He didn't ask me to marry him.
Ohh.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Your middle name is Pamela?
Yes.
Yes! Phoebe.
That's my first name.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Honey, we have been through this before!
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
You serious?!
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
When did this happen?
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
So, are you gonna see him again?
Tomorrow night.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Oh, thank you!
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Where are they? Where are they?
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Very informative!
Not at all inappropriate!
That was great, the kids loved you.
Yay, I rock.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Ohh, so cute.
I know. I'm mad at me too.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Cupid.
Man, do you know what guys want!
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Hey, is Chandler here?
No, no he went for a walk.
Hi!
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
No, nothing.
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Yes, Ross.
I love you.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
You bought boobs?
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Hey, guys, what's up.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Where ya going?
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Love....
No you know I don't mind.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
What?
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
To get you to make out with him!!!
Ohhh.
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Thank God.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
What is it hon?
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
Oh thank you.
No.
No thanks.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
Would ya care to venture one?
Would you care to venture one?
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
Oh-oh.
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Don't touch him!
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Oh!
...how about I move in with you?
Who's Denise?
My roommate.
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
Oy!!
What's with all this sand?
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
It's Joey.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Well, get it off now!
I can't! It-it's stuck!
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Can I please see your face?
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
That is the most ridiculous.
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Really?! How much?!
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Well try to keep it down.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
Are you okay?
I need some milk.
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Okay!
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Are you still mad at us?
Yep.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
Had it.
Had it.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Yesterday!
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Rachel, calm down!
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Oh yeah!
Hello, children!
Hey!
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Yeah.
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Yeah!
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
What?
Why would you say that?
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
Yeah that's right.
Huh, good luck!
Die Hard still great!
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Hey Chandler.
Hey Gar!
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
So how was, how was your date?
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Oh no, yeah.
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Hey!
Hey, man!
Damn!
Hey.
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
Hey, the man's dog just died.
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Okay!
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Aah!
Hey!
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
I'm the supply manager.
We don't need any toner.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
All right, let's move on.
Okay then.
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Phoebe!
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
I can't believe he did this.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
What do you mean, comforted her?
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
It's also a sign of friendship.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
You're not going?
Uh-huh.
No. Well, yeah, maybe.
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
Oh, what? What was it?
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Chicken or small?
Why aren't you at home in bed?
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
Yay!!
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
I can't do that.
There he is!
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
You know her?!
No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
Hang on.
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Yeah, Susan.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Help!
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
No!
I wasn't ready for it.
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Yeah?
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Er, yeah, it's mine.
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
Hey.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I won't leave you!
No you're not! Not to me!
Oh my God.
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
What?!
Hey!
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Thank you.
Any time.
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Okay. Okay.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
Yeah.
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Yes.
Three babies?
I finally got my band!
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You really think it would be that different?
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
What was that?
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
He's really picky about his patients.
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Saltines?
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
I know.
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Thank you guys-guys-guys...
Hey, aren't you up next?
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
No.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
So, what happens to the old guys?
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Wow umm, calm down.
Why are so mad at him?
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
All right!
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Oh my God, Phoebe.
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Hey.
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Totally.
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
It doesn't say that!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Oh just say it Kyle!
We're gonna give it another try.
I'm gonna work on that.
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
Ok, do you know A minor?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
What are you talking about?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Well, it's better than us deciding.
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
I've found.
I've found....
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
She's dead.
Are you sure?
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
17 years ago.
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
I know. I'm sorry.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh no, not you too!
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Hey!
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?!
What?!
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Whoa! Ohh!!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Phoebe?
Well, he stabbed me first!!
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
So what's going on with you?
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Yeah.
How long has it been since you had sex?
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
Right, I go-, I got it.
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
Hey, nice toilet.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Trouble?
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Well did you try calling her?
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
We didn't ruin it!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Glove salesman!
Good one! Yeah.
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Hey.
Hi.
Rachel lost Marcel.
Oh no, how?
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Please, I think you know why.
I can't think of anything.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
Okay.
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Your nails.
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
So, what are you gonna do?
Me?! Why me?
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
What?
What're you talkin' about?
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Haven't we made this decision?
Yeah, all right.
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Oh crap!
Oh crap!
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
What?
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
A wandering?
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
Hey, Paul!
Yeah?
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Hey!
Hey!
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
It isn't?
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Okay, one more time.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
What?!
Merrill Lynch?
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
What kinda things have you been saying?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
What?
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Pheebs, run!
Run, Phoebe, run!
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Ohh.
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Yeah!
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
No.
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
So then you know?
Oh, good. Thanks.
Now what is Fabutec?
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
Yeah she said something about crumbies.
No! No! No! I was so careful!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
You got fired?!
Oh my Gosh!
Sweety...
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
I found a dried up seashores.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
That guy's still doing that?!
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Ross! Wait!
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Ohhhhhh!
Oh my God!
Was it...
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
I know. I'm mad at me too.
Hey! Me too!
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
Hey.
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Hexadrin.
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Say what?
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
What do you mean?
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
But.
How did you know there was a but?
The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
I can do that.
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
No, Frank.
Yeah, refrigerator college.
Yeah.
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
I can't take any...
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
You don't have any secrets!
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
What?
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
Monica said that did she?
A little salami.
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Ahh.
Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
I love you.
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
What do you mean?
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
What?
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
Alright.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Vanilla?!
Yeah.
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Beef.
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Really?
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
There's more beer, right?
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Please tell me you're joking.
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Excuse me?
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Oh, I read that in high school.
Hi.
What's wrong buddy?
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That was not funny!
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
That's not Ross!
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
Are you serious?!
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
Oh, I was unbelievable.
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
Look, look!
Hey, what's this?!
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
What's this?
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
Well, what happened?
Ohhhhhh!
Oh my God!
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
Yes.
Yes.
So?
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Yum-my!
Larry?
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No reason, except...she...told...me.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
What?
What?!
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Wait! What about Joey?
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
It sure is.
Beef.
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
I'm, I'm still me.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
That saves us a conversation.
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Why not? What's going on?
By being in a box?
Joey, had reasons.
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
Hey!!
Hey!
Oh my God!!
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
What?! No! Why?!
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
I didn't know you could get married here.
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
I'm gonna start getting ready!
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Oh my God, Phoebe.
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
I do, I believe you.
You do Pheebs?
Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
Step away from the duck.
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
What?
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
What about my cab?
I don't need that anymore.
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
Wait, you can't take the money out.
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Hey! What are you doing here?
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Just for a second.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
No, you stop!
You stop!
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Yeah, I'm good.
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
Yes.
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
You meant sex, right?
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Are you serious?
I call it!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.


I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
What is this?!
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
And this- is my reward!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
What? What? What?!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Oh!... Right!
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
Hey Joey.
Hey Phoebs.
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Well, now I do!!
I'm sorry.
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
And a date with a man!
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
Who the hell are all these people?
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
I was her accountant four years ago.
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Betrothed...
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
What are you talking about? Keep it!
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Oh!
No-no! I-I...I found one.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
You're right.
You know.
Thank you. So are we good?
We're good.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Just a smidge.
I think it's romantic.
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
Nooo! Why would you think that?
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.
You really thought it was perfect?
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Huh?
Where's your bed?
What?
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
Thank you.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Well that wasn't easy.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
That's too bad.
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Hey, what's going on?
Hey!
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
What? I don't see anything.
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
Hey, Pheebs!
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
What's going on?
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Well, at least you scared someone.
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Oh my God!
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Yeah!!
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Ameri-can.
Ameri-ccan.
Everybody!!
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
You said it was okay!
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Hey!
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
There he is!
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!


C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Thank you.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Joey, speed it up!
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Sir! No sir!
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Hi honey.
Hi!
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Men just take out wind?
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
What? That's terrible!
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Hey! Me too!
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
I missed you too.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Hey, how are you holding up?
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Thanks!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
What?!
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Really?!
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Hey-hey-hey!
What are you doing?
Oh, all right.
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Where are you going?
Work people? Nobody told me.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Hi.
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Well when can we have this shower?
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Yesterday!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
How did it go with Erin?
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Didn't you sleep together?
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Put it out!!
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
We don't, really.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
So he likes to break stuff.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Right.
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
We did have fun, didn't we?
We did!
Oh, I would love to!
Yay, okay!
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Now, does it really matter?
Yes!!
Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
Does so count!
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
I don't want to hear about her!!
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
Ohh great!!!
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Thanks a lot.
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Hey.
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Hey.
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Well...
Oh my God!
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Oh, just updating the phonebook.
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
Just, you know, to see... um.
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Yeah, okay.
Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
You always said I'd make it.
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
OK.
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
Hey!
Hey!
Really?! How do you know?
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Go for it.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
It's Le Poo.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Yeah?
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Hey!
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
Her name's Debra.
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Sure.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
What's Flimby's?
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
No it's not, sorry.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
No you can't.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Oh, I already have one.
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Hey, I know I what I want!
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
Her answer machine?
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Sorry!
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
I hope he did!
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
No, just singing.
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
May I help you ladies?
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Yeah, right.
Come on, I need your help here.
You see this, this is a friend.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
How do you know Frank?
Yeah. Frank.
Yeah. What?
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Hey! We're here!
Hey!
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Hey, kids.
Hey.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
This is insane!
What?!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Yaaaay!
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
It's Phoebe.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Umm, yeah-no thanks.
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
Thanks again.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
No, no, no, that's Dina.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
That was me.
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
I hate men! I hate men!
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Hey!
Hey!
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Yeah, were better off without them.
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
More coffee over here, please!
Well, what happened?
Ooooohh!
My God.
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Bite me, blondie!
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Yeah!
Wow!
Yeah. I guess.
Just get your nails done?
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
What?
Oh yeah!
No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Chandler what do you say?
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
Hey!
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
Open bar!
Well now it's an empty bar.
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
I won! That was my guess!
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Yeah.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
Maureen Rosilla.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Pheebs!!
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
It was a hug!
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
Oh.
Hey.
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
What? Why, why would...
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
We have good news, look whose back!
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
I'm good.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Don't get me started on that.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Mm-mmm.
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
Oh, am I on the radio?
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
You are so smitten.
I am not.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
So. You two are totally into each other.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Huuh.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
Brides magazines?
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Oh my God.
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
Prague?
There's sooo much you don't know.
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
I haven't seen it yet!
Noooooooo!!
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Please, let me do something.
Okay.
Okay.
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
If you want, I'll do it.
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Ben, dinner!
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
What did you just do?
I licked my arm, what?
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Great, you can cover Chandler.
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
You cuddled.
Yeah, which was nice.
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
What-what Richard thing?
Oh no.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
Hey, and then lunch.
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
What?! No! Why?!
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Yeah, totally!
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Ross!
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
This is the coolest house ever!!
All right!
I would!
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
What?! Why?!
Please, I think you know why.
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Ooh, I look good.
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
And also, my birthday.
It's not your birthday.
Hey!
Hey!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Damn! It's empty!
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
What?!
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
This stuff is great!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
You do? Why?
Because I think it means more to you.
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Yeah, why not?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
I love you too Chandler.
Dude!
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Hey guy!
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Really Joey?
What?
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Obviously not to Joey.
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
He started mine first!
Whoa! Big octopus.
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
Hey! Ross!
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
What?! No!
Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
Hi Ginger.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
All right.
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Really?!
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
I found a dried up seashores.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
That was there when I got here.
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
No we weren't!
I was not!
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Pick me!!
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know...
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Raymond Chandler.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
All right I'll have one.
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Why? Why can't you go to him?
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Chandler.
Come on in.
Sure.
So, here we are. Nervous?
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
Better. Yeah.
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Phoebe Buffay?!
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
That's not mine.
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Does it still hurt?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hey, how'd it go?
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
What does it say?!
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Thanks! So are you.
Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Oh.
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
A little salami.
Pastrami.
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
Hey, Pheebs!
Mornin' Pheebs!
Was his name Angus?
What?
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
So I guess you all saw it.
Saw what?
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
Oh o-, OK man.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
Monica.
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Thank you.
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
Come on, lady!
Please, please take him too.
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Oh, here's a great one.
Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Yay!
Yay!
Okay!
Ooh, uh...
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
Bye.
Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
Wine?
Please.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Okay.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Oh my God! What happened?
You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
But it is our apartment!
No it's not!
MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Oh, really.
Well, I was having a conversation.
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Oh, yay!
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
Yes.
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
No he's not!
Yes, he is!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
You have chalk on your face.
Huh?
Hey, are you okay?
My wife's a lesbian.
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Yeah.
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
Hey!
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
You made it!
You're there!
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Ahhh.
Yeah, right.
Good deal.
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
Yay me.
So, so how did it happen?
And what did he say?
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
Bodington's! Woohoo!
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
Nothing. Nothing.
What? What's wrong?
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
God! Ross!
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
What, what is it?
You missed a belt loop.
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Great!
This is beautiful!
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
I don't know, it looks the same.
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Really?
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
Ok so will he be back soon?
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Yeah!
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Because it's my apartment!
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Hi!
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Hi!
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Oh yeah!
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Hormones.
...hormones, yeah.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
She's talking.
Yay!
That he doesn't exist.
Right.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
Hey.
Hey. Hi Phoebe.
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
How would you like to pay?
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
I'll give you $1 for them.
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Hey!
Hey, how'd it go?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Okay.
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
Hey Phoebe.
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Rach, you're in my seat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I pick you, Phoebe.
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
It's all right.
Now, which of you is the father?
Okay...
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
Naked alone time.
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Easy.
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Oh!
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Okay!
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Yep. Okay.
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Sure.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Yeah. O-okay.
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
No you're not.
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
Hello? Hi.
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
What are you gonna do?
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
I know!!
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
They have the best stuff in there.
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, what is it?
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
What?
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Ohh, tough call.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
I was.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Okay!
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Yay, okay!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Um... Done!
Hey!
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
You didn't!
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Yeah?
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Central... Park!
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
Alright.
Good luck Phoebs.
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
What about the part where he has rabies?
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Hey! What are you doing here?
Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
Wh..
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Oh, you're not a dingus.
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Great! Problem solved!
Well, back to square one.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Hey, dude!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Why not?
Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
Oh, I get a puppy!!
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
Okay, what else?
Oh.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
No, you?
You just asked me.
Okay. I am so hot!
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
Who-who else is in vice up there?
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
We just want you to think it through.
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
It's coming from Joey!
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
What do you mean?
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Hangs up.
Hey.
Hi. Mom. Dad.
Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know...
No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
What?!
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Come on baby, come on!
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
You're good. You're good!
Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Hey, do you have any gum?
Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
Okay, they're just talking...
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
What? What? What?!
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
No, inside good, outside bad.
She's one of us now.
Hi you guys.
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
No no no!
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Yeah, alright.
Alright. Phoebe?
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Here you go sweetie.
But, I put some honey in it.
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
I swear you said you had the keys.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Why would I have the keys?
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
How is it you?
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
I can't believe you bought this.
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Damnit!
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
You have other friends?
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Oh. Uh, I'm on.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
That's...kinda hot.
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
I was not and oh God, shh!
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Well...
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Yeah, whatever.
It's your turn.
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
What one?
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
Ohh great!!!
But, he loves Emily?
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
I'm just helping the kids!
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Mr. Tribbiani.
Oh hi!
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Tony?
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Yeah. So?
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Well, may I ask for one example?
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
I don't think so.
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Oh.
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
Dad?
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
You're smoking again?!
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Weren't you nine?!
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
So long, Vic!
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Another good point.
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
I'm sorry?
Hey! You wanna go?
Yeah, let's go.
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Thanks Monica!
Does that smell bother you?
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Why are you being weird?
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Oh my God.
I know. I need more pie.
You didn't break up with that fireman?
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
Phoebe, listen...
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Really?
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
It sure is.
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
That chick can't handle my corner.
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Rachel?
No. How are ya Paul?
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
So now what's going on here?
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Uh, wh-why?
No! It's nice!
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Or?
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?
Here you go sweetie.
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Such as?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
Nah. Not really.
Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
What?
Oh.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Hey.
We were just talking about you.
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
Really?
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
What?
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Hey.
Hey!
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
You didn't tell her did you?
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
And?
And we did.
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
Uh-huh.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Looking up?
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
Of course not.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Hey.
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Still broken?
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
What about my friend Victor?
Alright, let me just get my coat.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
This?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
That is true.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Really?
But again, Simmons. Go on.
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
Ick, you were eavesdropping.
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
No thanks, Mom!
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Good deal.
Hi!
Hey!
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Seriously, it's moving!
What the hell is in there?
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
How is she?
How's the hair?
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Phoebe?
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
There it is.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
All right! Let's do it!
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Who?
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
You don't play the oboe!
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
Really?! How do you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
I think it's romantic.
Yeah!
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
A little bit, yeah.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
So where you gettin' it?
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
So, I'm here, ready to play.
Okay.
What's this?
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Hey.
Hey!
Where?!
On the touchy.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
I don't think you mean that.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
Then don't break in!!
I'm sorry.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Ohh.
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
No?
Oh!
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Oh, I know.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Oh my god good?
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
Let go!
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Okay everyone, think thick.
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
You mean like a doctor?
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Hi.
Hi.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
Oh! Oh!
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Ohh!!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Bye!
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Uh, 10:30.
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
Heavy.
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
What?
What're you talkin' about?
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
Philadelphia.
Really?
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Uh, no not really. Why?
Are you funny?
Excuse me?
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hey!
Did you find the dress?
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Really.
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Oh, there's banana on it.
So then you know?
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Okay!
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
July. Umm,
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Okay.
Okay.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Well I. . .
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
How do you not fall down more?
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
Well at least we know she's a woman.
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
All right.
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Ugh!
What?
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
M-M-Mole people?
I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
Where did you get this number?
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Hey, how you doin'?
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Daddy cut me off.
Never mind, I got it.
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
But I'm...
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!
That's a plane!
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Aww, Pheebs.
Honey, that's you're name.
Hey! You're wearing pants!
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Okay.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Yeah.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Hello Rachel.
Get off.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
What?
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
These old things.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
Yeah.
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
These are her earrings.
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
I think he can be.
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
Your not doing it.
When's your birthday?
Feburary 16th.
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Can I sleep on your couch?
Rachel?
Yeah.
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
Here comes the bride.
Oh my God Monica!
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Nice try.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
You gave him cookies?
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Or?
Burning's good.
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Wh-what do you mean?
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
That had to hurt!
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
But I think we should tell her.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Hey.
What?
Is everything okay?
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Just, just, just pick one!
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
What?!
What?!
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be that guy?
Okay, shoot.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
Honey.
Oh.
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Thank you.
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Hey!
Hi!
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Umm, cups.
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
You've never asked a guy out?!!
No. Have you?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Ugh!
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Gary.
Okay, so it's a date.
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Ohh, impressive.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
OK, is this really my father?
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Look, I. . .
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
What we did last night was....
Stupid.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Hey guys!
Hey.
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Is everything okay?
Are you all right?
Pheebs! Sorry!
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Two pizzas?!
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Huh?
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Not one that can pee on the roof.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
How who wears it?
Demi Moore.
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
What does she mean?
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
All right, I'll try not to.
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
Good for me!
Y'okay, Phoebe?
What did they do to you?
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
I was thinkin' about it.
Hi Phoebe.
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Oh, they love your casserole.
Yes!!
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
And you?
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
All right, be my guest.
Good luck.
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Yeah but Phoebe...
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Yeah, he's head of the department.
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Sure?
Hi!
Hey.
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
Hi.
Hey.
Oh.
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Nah. I kept myself busy.
Hey! Are you okay?
Fabulous.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
She's not even here yet.
What's with the guitar?
Where the hell have you been?
We stopped at the gift shop.
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
Hey! My first review is out!
All right, look at my on the back page.
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
Yes!! Ohh.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
So, I figured it out.
What?
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Maybe nobody's tried this.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Unbelievable.
Thank you so much.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
The little ones do.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
What?! Why?!
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Yeah, what town are we near?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
I'm pretty.
Hey does anyone have any gum?
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Hey!
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
How ya feelin'?
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Hey.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
And for you?
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Anything else?
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
Hi!
Hey, Phoebe.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
Better. Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You wanna try it again?
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
Youre not gonna lose him.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
What are you saying I should do?
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Ohh! No.
Why not?
No you're not.
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.
Hey.
Hey.

Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
'Cause that's just your taste.
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Okay.
Are you alright?
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Hey sweetie!
Ready to go?
Wait a minute!
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Which one?
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Are you calling me selfish?!
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
Hello.
Hello, Ross?
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
You're twins?
What does she do?
She's a waitress.
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
What?
You found me a guy?
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
I-I'll call ya.
Okay.
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Well, I have a call in about that.
'Kay.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Yeah, you're on your own.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
Hey.
Hey.
No.
Yes.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
I do too.
Bye Phoebe.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Guys, I'm happy too.
Okay, come here!
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Bye.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Look out kids, he's coming!
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
What? Me having a job?
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Pirates again?
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
I know, but look at me all tan.
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
What?!?!
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
I had a problem.
Hey, Pheebs?
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Uh-huh!
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
No you didn't!
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Okay, woo! Hi.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Mine!
Wait! It was my plan.
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Hello!
Hey!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
Yeah, that's true.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Hey.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
It's a buffet man.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Oh, god.
Ok, got the vent open.
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
What do you see?
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
He doesn't do much, does he?
No, this is pretty much it.
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Nu-uh!
I told that guy who answered your phone.
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
I know.
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
What the hell is going on?!
We took our apartment back!!
We are switching back, right now!
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
What are you talking about?
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
We will.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
So am I!
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
I don't need any toner.
Not me.
May I ask why?
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Oh Pheebs.
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Don't even get me started on yours!
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Fascinating.
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Ah!
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
I'll be waiting.
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Yeah?
I found my identical hand twin!
No!
But she just came up here!
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Nothing-Why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
We don't need any toner.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Did that!
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
I was just being polite, but, alright.
What's up?
What?
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
No you didn't!
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
I know, I'm so excited!
So am I!
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Which, is the new plan!
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Come on Rach, let's go.
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Well what did you send?
A basket of mini-muffins.
The small one.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
Hi.
Hi! What-what're you doing here?
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Yeah.
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Yes!!!
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Where's my seat belt?
Hey!
Hey.
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
Hey!
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Hello.
I love this friend thing!
Oh.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
My joke wasn't funny.
Really?!
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Oh! No problem! I...
What?
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Probably Monica and Chandler.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Hmm.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Me too.
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Well, I guess now we can't go.
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Honey that sounds like fun.
Okay.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Oh.
Oh, good.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Okay.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
I like her.
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Look at you. All jealous.
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
They actually said that?
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Happy plane-aversary.
Aww! I love you!
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
To Monica!
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Hey!
Hey!
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
1250.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Yeah.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Ohh.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
What?!
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
I'll give up my ticket.
Me too.
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Sure.
What are you doing with those?!
Sorry, Phoebe.
It's okay. How's the soup?
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
My God.
Are you sure?
Was it...?
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
Hey.
Hey.
Eeeshk.
Yeah, big stuff.
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Ohh!
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Congratulations!
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
I know. This is really, really huge.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
What? You just click when they click.
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Aww.
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
Gimme 'em!
No! They are mine!
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
I love you too.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
A couple of bucks.
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Is everything ok?
Oh my god.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Rrrreally.
...Now? Now?
Oh yeah, right now.
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
But, he loves Emily?
Okay.
All right, so, okay...
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Yeah.
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Yeah?
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Yeah?
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
Well, you know that psychic I see?
Yeah?
What?!
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Yeah.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
Bye.
Bye, good luck.
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
What does she mean by HH?
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
You guys!! Come on!
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Yeah. You!
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
All right.
It's not that weird, is it?
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
It's okay, these things happen.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
So, what happens to the old guys?
Well, they go into the chipper.
Hey! Hey!!
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
You had sex with her didn't you?
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
Right.
Okay?
No. Why?
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
Well?
Look at this!
Oh! You have a window!
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
I-I like pizza!
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Hey!
Are you guys ready?
Okay.
Okay.
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Like what?
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
Ugh, okay Sherlock!
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Okay.
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Nope, nope, that's it.
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Oh, OK.
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
Thanks, see you at the party.
Okay, great!
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
I'll take sports.
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
I did it anyway.
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
Wow!
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
Oh, sweetie, oh.
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
What-what are you talking about?!
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
Yeah, okay.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
That's not gonna work.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Monica bang!
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Uh.
What?
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Really! That-that great huh?
Hey!
Hi you guys!
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Lots of responses.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
: We have apple cinnamon...
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
Why?
Man, I am so beat.
Oh yeah.
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
I could've been killed I hope you know!
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Phoebe.
What?! What the hell?!
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
Really?
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
Run Phoebe run.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Are you kidding me?
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Ohhhh.
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Are you sure?
Oh that's great!
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
Your fly is open, Geller.
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
No, but he's always late.
I thought you only met him once?
Well relax, he'll be here.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
What?!
Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Yes! Oh no!
Oh. Uh, what?
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Should I not have told you?
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
I love you, too.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Come on, like you never talk that.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
What are you talking about? Keep it!
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
So, you're like a zillionaire?
And you're our age. You're our age.
What like Pete Dakota?
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Excuse me, is this your car?
Yeah.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
Hey!
Hi!
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Yes!
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Look, I do not re-love her.
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
I don't what your talking about.
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
What?
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Is it dry in here?
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
Hey, big guy, game time.
Hey, be right there.
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
Oh yeah?
Yeah!
A face ass?
A chin dimple!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Hey. It happened!
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Why are you taking this away from me?
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Watching ballroom dancing?
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Like what?
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
Fired! Why?
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
No.
I see.
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
They do me?
I don't sound like that.
Oh, oh Chandler...
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
Well, you're not working either.
Yes, but I'm doing this.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Go, go, go!
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
You what?
Oh my God!
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Well, are any of those people here?!
Oh, no!! No, no!
Hey, everybody!
Wow!!
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Are you OK?
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
No.
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
An old cookie?
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
We can't accept this.
Why not?
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
I know, it's great!
Aww, I don't want to see that!
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Why would we be freaked?
Oh.
Right.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
I don't think so.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
Okay. I'm going with you.
Why?!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
Getting it away from me would be job one.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
God, what is wrong with me.
You need to get some sleep.
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
What does the sign say?
Beam me up Jesus.
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Oh!
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
Well, do you see any babies?
How do you feel?
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
What's going on?
So, for the whole weekend?
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Oh my god.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Oh, honey.
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Yeah, why not?
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
Were you this cute in high school?
Oh stop.
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
There she is.
Mom!
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Yes.
Hexadrin.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
And did he?
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Yes, I am!
Hey Rach.
Joey.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Could everyone please take their seats?
Okay.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Who is it?
It is your office.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
That's not the end.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Hey.
How's it going?
So what's going on?
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
I know. They were mine.
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
That's weird!
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
No, I just, I fell down.
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
You didn't get it?
No.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Okay.
Hello children!
Hey!
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
No-no, we do it every year!
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
What's going on?
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
I know. Thanks.
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Thanks.
And you're so sweet. And you're kind
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
No!
Do you like car games?
Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
'Kay!
Oh my God!
Yes! Yes, I did.
Then do Iceberg!
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Dude, we were good!
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
You get the dollhouse.
I get the dollhouse!
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
No, just a barrel.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Phoebe!
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Hey!
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Yes!!
Then yes that is what I'm having.
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Rachel said that!
Well Rachel's not here!
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Son of a bitch!
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Anything larger back there?
I can't believe it.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
You're an opthamologist.
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
See.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Bye.
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Really?
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Nice!
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Hey!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
I don't know, clean places?
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
Yeah, he's gotta go.
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
The new girl's good.
Hey guys! Hey!
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
We were just waxing our legs.
Off?!!
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Stripping!
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Make a wish?
The bigger half.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Oh good.
Yeah, me too!
Oh, look at that.
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Congratulations!
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
About how good your cards were.
Heh... I was bluffing.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Oh, that's true.
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Huddle up.
All right, huddle up, right over here.
Okay.
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
Phoebe, tell her!
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
You're kidding. Oh my God.
What's going on?
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
That is so unfair.
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
We want the last six years back!!
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
The guy still won't put out, huh?
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Yes, every single one of them.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
So you're free Thursday, then.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Pirates again?
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Alright, let me just get my coat.
Is it true they have beer?
Everything you've heard is true.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
You mean like watch?
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
Oh, put him on!
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
What?
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
What?!
With Ross and Jill?
Yeah!
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
What's going on?
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Wow. Thank you.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
Phoebe...
Yeah?
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
I finally got my band!
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Why would we be freaked?
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Hey.
Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
So you watched the movies huh?
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
Phoebe!
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
In this life, Phoebe.
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Nooo.
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Oh yeah!
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
God, you are so strong.
Oh my God! That is so good!
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
That was not funny!
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Really?
Okay.
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
No!
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
What's the second part of your plan?
My Saturn dealership.
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
Wow! This girl is good.
I like her.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Okay bye.
All right. Bye.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
I miss you already!!
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
All right.
What are you talking about?
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Oh my God.
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Relaxi-Taxi!
The name was my favourite part!
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
The little jail between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Me neither.
Me too.
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
But I like it here!
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Great!
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
Rachel.
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Oh Drake.
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
All right, see you later.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Umm, okay.
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
There's a Mr. Bing!
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
See, I didn't know that.
Well, there you go.
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
That's not the end.
What about the part where he has rabies?
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Hi. Where is everybody?
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Oh no! Why?
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Okay.
Sign here.
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Umm, a flea market?
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
Ohh, yes.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Well, have fun!
Okay.
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Hey!
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Oh no, not you too!
Nice!
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
You're welcome.
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
What? Ow!
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Yes! Did you see that?
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Can we just start throwing things in?
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
No we weren't!
I was not!
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
You lost 13 million dollars.
Are you all right?
I'm having another heart attack!
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
Sorry-sorry Jill.
What'd you get?
Oh.
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Good! Great! You can go first.
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
What?
They put you in jail?
The little jail between the doors!
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
Oh, so that's what this is for.
Yeah.
Sure is.
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Well, I think we all learned something.
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
Y'know what that means?
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
The baby shower for Phoebe!
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Great. Great.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
We love you, we're here for you.
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
You do, huh?
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
American Express?
I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
You're going to Minsk.
No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Look, I. . .
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
Oh God.
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
What?!
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Maybe on some level.
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Yes, good! Ok...
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
The end.
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
Yeah.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
Because I think it means more to you.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Man alive!
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Thanks.
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Men are here.
We make fire. Cook meat.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Give it!
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Thank God.
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Hey!
Oh.
So, we're off.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
All right, see ya Pheebs.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
What's going on?
Chandler's gone again!
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Not at these prices.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
There's no dog in here.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
What is it doing here?
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
Then do Iceberg!
G-sharp.
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
No, but you're questioning my method!
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Sorry.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
And did he?
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Okay, great.
Okay.
'Kay, put your head back.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Okay.
Okay.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
If you want it to be.
Here's your girlfriend's button.
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Ohh. Ouch.
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
But we've only had one job.
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
No!
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
What are you guys gonna do?
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
The name was my favourite part!
Well, well I can up with it!
Well, I...
Hello.
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
All right, Joey, same question.
Uhh, they're tall.
That's not even a game!
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Hi.
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Really?
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Fine.
Fine,
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Forget about it.
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Pick me!!
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
Yeah.
What's twisted?
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
Uhh.... waitressing?
Huh, Bob Saget?
Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Dude, you soooo need this car.
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
Right, why do you keep saying that?
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
So, what's up?
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
I'm sorry.
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
He just got a divorce right?
Hmm-mmm.
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
You've never asked a guy out?!!
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
But I already gave them back to you!
No you didn't.
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
October 25th.
Melt stuff.
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
No, it's fate!
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
I'm actually the office manager.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
That's not gonna work.
Hey! I didn't know either.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Why, do you write him a lot?
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
The Waltham Residence.
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
We'll be waiting for you...
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Every year.
Halftime.
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Oh, come on!
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
No, not us... Us!
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
It doesn't say that!
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Uh-huh.
You guuuyys.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
All right, I'll try not to.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
You let Joey drive it?!
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
I didn't get it?
Okay, what else?
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
See there it is right there.
Wow! It's small.
So you had fun, huh?
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Which is why my answer is yes!
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Still in love with?!
Yeah!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
17 years ago.
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Hey.
Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go?
You mean a three pointer?
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
When did I sign for it?
Did you make brownies today?
Knock, knock.
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
God Joey, this is taking forever!
What's the rush? What?
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well... It's a date.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
Oh, okay.
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
All right, see ya Pheebs.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
What'd you think I was, a hooker?
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Fine. I don't like you!!
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
That's a plane!
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
No. No, you can't.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Hey!
Hi.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
Oh, oh, good.
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...

Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
Oh, ah with who?
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Isn't he great?
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Hi, Julie.
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Do we need a cake?
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Uh-huh.
Wh-what did he say?!
Why?! Why not?!
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Eww!!
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
Wow.
Great!
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Hey!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
Foxy lady.
Where you goin'?
The Ice Capades?
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
I wanna quit the bank!
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
What?!
Merrill Lynch?
Well why didn't you take the job?
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Yeah! We are!
We're the Cobras!
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
I'm right here!!!!
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
I'm kidding!
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
I mean this poor woman.
What woman?
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Yes, I will tell her.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
What?!
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
You went shopping for fur?
You bought boobs?
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
That's a defense?
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Uh-huh.
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
What?! You slept with Jason?
You'd already broken up.
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
You mean like watch?
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
My God!
Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Oh he knows! For the most part.
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
What?
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!
You're Erwin's daughter?!
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Phoebe that's not true.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Who was it?
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Well, I never call me.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
Oh, that is so sick.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
So have you called her yet?
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
What?!
Ohh, this cake is really good!
Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Oooh!
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Really!
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Hey guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Why can't you use the phone in here?
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Ross, don't start.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Was it not pain-free?
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
I really like waking up with you.
That would be great!
We could have breakfast in bed...
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Can we see her?
Yeah.
How're you doing?
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
You didn't!
The park huh? A public place.
Uh-huh.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Maybe because you've got the keys?
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
No.
I guess you weren't there.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Here's my binoculars.
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Oh, yeah. What's this?
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Isn't it.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
Hey you guys.
Hey.
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
Who are you talking too?
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
Hey!
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
What?!
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
It's got 'em!
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Maybe you could be my roommate!
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
How have you never been on Oprah?
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Totally.
Phoebe are you serious?
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
No!
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Here you go.
Good for you!
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
He would like to kiss you.
Oh.
Oy!
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Yeah?
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
No!
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
You think you know me so well.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Fish!
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
We did have fun, didn't we?
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Oh, seriously?
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five actually.
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Stop it. Stop it!
Hi, this is Richard.
You have three new messages.
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Aww crap!
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Why?!
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
What?!
What?
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Hey you guys, guess what?
The British are coming?
Ohh.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Well, people are different.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
What?!?!
You can spill. In the sink.
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
How about we talk about this over dinner?
Okay lady, you're out of here.
I'm just taking you outside!
Oh, okay.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
So how are things going with Paul?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Ohh.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
No-no!! No!!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
It's Monica's bed. What?
Okay. It's a racecar.
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
You wanna try it again?
Yeah. From the top?
Ok.
Mmmm hmmm.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Hey, I might!
You're kidding. Oh my God.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
We didn't change..
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
Okay!
Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Yeah.
I can.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
Yeah. Hate him.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
...No, we hate him.
We're sorry.
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
Look at you! You're up!
All right!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
No. I've learned my lesson.
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
What d'you think?
Lotsa things.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Really?
Oh, do you not want to?
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Oh, you're not a dingus.
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Well thanks.
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
How have you never been on Oprah?
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Oh, I don't know, a million?
I'm fine.
All right.
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
I see.
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
Who's Barney.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Noo.
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
I didn't know that.
I never knew that either.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Ugh!
Pheebs, how's it going?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
They're your backup singers... beind you.
Alrighty. From the top.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
About four hours.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Oh, that is better.
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
Oh, we have some...
No you don't!
A tad.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Yeah, I think we are.
This isn't even my dress.
I'm changing out of this.
Me too.
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
It's gonna be so great.
Hi! What's going on?
But Phoebe...
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
All right. Be sexy.
Please.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
Huh.
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
Yeah.
That's true!
That's true!
No, you cannot.
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
No you can't.
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
No.
Yes!
Then don't touch one!!
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
No. I am not putting on makeup.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Looks good. I'll take it.
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
That's a good call. Right.
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
I saw it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Look, I do not re-love her.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
No!
Phoebe...
Hey Joey.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
We don't need to remedy that.
Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Oh yeah.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
We have to get her a present?!
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
Oh my God!!
My God!
Are you serious?
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
A thumb?!
Eww!
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
No, I wanna melt it.
Yeah!
G'night, bro.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Okay.
I will, I will find him.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
One of the babies is kicking.
I thought that was a good thing.
Hey!
Hey!
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
They published my paper.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Hey!
Wheel!
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Hey.
Hey! Oh.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Good one! Yeah.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Uh.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
You sound like a guy.
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Ok, all done.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Why would we do that?
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Does anybody know me?!
What's wrong Phoebe?
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
OK.
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
What?! Why?
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Hey!
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Oh.
Wow, that's great.
Oh, yeah!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Let's run towards them!
OK!
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
I may have.
Woo-hoo, stuud!
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Never call me from that phone.
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Okay, let's go!
Atlantic City!
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
So what are you gonna do?
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Uh--
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
But why does it even matter?!
Why does it matter so much to you?!
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Yes? Yes! Oh.
What are you doing?
Were you following me?
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
All right, so, okay...
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Right!
So tell me about this girl?
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
What song was that, Pheebs?
Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
Oh.
Oh.
I got it!
Is it back in the cage?
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
How do you know?
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Ross, you don't have to yell.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
Yeah?
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
You told me.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Me too.
Hey.
This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
Yes!!
Yes! She's very excited about that.
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
What?!
Hey!
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
What's Flimby's?
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
I'm the student.
Isn't she cute? No!
Oh, we're not together.
Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
I own this store.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Yeah.
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
You look good.
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Really?
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Oh!
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
Oh wow! This is so cool.
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Why?
Because he's stealing from me!
Ughh!
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
Me?! Why me?
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
That is so sweet!
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Were you following me?
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
What are you talking about?
Everybody knows!
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
What did they do to you?
Easy.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
Hm-mm.
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Oh no, not yet.
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Oh man! I did it again!
I gotta get the before shot!
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Multiple orgasms!
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
No!
Okay.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Okay.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Duly noted.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
All right, so what were you thinking?
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
What?
I'm not Jewish, so...
Bad dream?
I wasn't sleeping.
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Yeah, were better off without them.
Divorced men's club.
Potato, Potaato.
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Oh my God!
So you wanna get some dinner?
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
Okay!
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Then what's the problem?
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Hey, what did your agent say?
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
This is going in your book?
What?! Excuse me!
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Okay sure!
Really?!
Call it even?
Okay.
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
Hi.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
Yeah?
This is Patrick.
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
You just said it!
Oh Phoebe!
What?! That's the first time today!
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Okay, your highness.
Is he here?
No.
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Yeah?
How's that going?
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Stegosaurus!
Tyrannosaurus!
Where are you going?
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
All right.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
His indian name?
Freakish.
Wow.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Yeah that's the same.
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Which one?
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Wow!
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
How did it go?
I lost our mattresses.
Hey!
Hi!
I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.

I'm done now.

Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Wh-what do we do?
I don't know!
I know! What?!
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Uh yeah, right here.
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Excuse me, where are you going?
Uh... to the bathroom.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Uh-huh, yeah.
Dying people say the craziest things.
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Yeah?
I want you to move in with me.
Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
I'll help you fix your sweater.
I'll help you throw out your purse.
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
Where ya going?
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Well, are any of those people here?!
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
But I can't tell you.
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
No.
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Rachel?
Yeah?
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
Oh, hi Ross!
What are you doing?
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
You chipped in?!
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
I brought you alphabet soup.
Did you pick out the vowels?
Saltines?
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
What? What?
Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
Hi, did you order some bananas?
What about it?
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
You never know.
Ok, Phoebe.
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Well, it just seems that...
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Yeah, yeah!
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Oh my God!
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
What was that?
Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
We dare.
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Yeah.
So what-what is the exhibit.
Oh man!
Hey!
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
What-what do you mean?
Oh.
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
You think I should?
I really do, yeah.
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
Oh, wait a minute honey.
Phoebs.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Hey!
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Paolo. Hi.
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Why not?
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
You OK?
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
And Monica knows...
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
I ate a bug.
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Oh, now you want a favour?
Yes, please.
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
We're with you. We got it.
Chandler, what are you doing?
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
No. Why?
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
No that is the last thing you want to do!
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Bye!
Later!
Wow umm, calm down.
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
I don't know.
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Thank you. We both forgive you.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
What?!
Phoebe that's crazy!
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
No, I don't know him.
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
I-I sure will, take care.
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Nah. Not really.
You don't believe in evolution?
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Interesting.
So I was wondering....
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Hey!
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
You guys, I am not that bad!
That is so unfair!
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
What do you see?
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Wait! You forgot your legs!
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Oh hey, Pheebs!
Hey!
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Who is this?
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
I promise.
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Yes.
How?
Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
No, it's fate!
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
You guys are here! Yay!
Hi!
Pancho Vila?
Yeah!
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
You're welcome.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Oh, is he hungry already?
I guess so.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
Then don't do that, alright?
Okay!
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Ooh.
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
I don't think so.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Thank you.
Sure.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
Yeah, okay.
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Really? From who?
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
Give it.
No.
Oh God help me.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Yeah. So how have you been doing?
I, umm, shut up!
Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Noooo!!
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Wh-what do you mean?
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Oh, I got it.
Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
Why?!
Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.
Ohh great!! Hello.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Oh.
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Thank you, buddy.
You could do that!
Y'think?
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
I live upstate.
Yeah, so did I.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God.
Good, so do I
Something to do with numbers?
What?
Nothing. Nothing.
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
It was just a kiss.
Thunder being stolen!!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
And everybody knows this?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
Oh, sweetie, oh.
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
What?
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
No way!
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Um, this?
Yes.
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
I think Saturday-.
What's with him?
Okay!
Hey.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
All right. All right.
Really? I don't...
Sing!!
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Yeah baby!
Yeah, well...
We could get that Everest video though.
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
Phoebe!
Why is this car in my bedroom?
When did I sign for it?
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Well the duck can swim.
Oh, jeez.
Way to go, Phoebe!
That cold makes you sound so great.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
No-no-no-no-no.
No.
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
Let go! Let go!
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
And his puppet too.
Who?
Paul.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Sure!
He got it a flea market!
Hey!
Hi!
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Pheebs! Sorry!
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
Hi!
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
And say nothing?
Uh-huh, yeah that's right.
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
Sure.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Aghh.
Me too.
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Oh, wow.
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
I love you too.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
Then you are neither of your parents!
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
They actually said that?
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
And I would have to say pah-huh.
What?
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Oh, my.
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Oh, okay.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
That was me.
Oh, en chante.
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?

...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
No. No, that's- that's okay.
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Ok.
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Yeah baby!
Honey! Dinner's ready!
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
Ahhhhh!
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Huh. That's nice.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
Wow!
Okay, I think I got it.
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
I promise.
All right, that's it, I quit.
What? I didn't say anything.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
London is stupid! Stupid!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
I'll do it!
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Oh!
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Pheebs!!
Speech! Come on Monica!
Come on!
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
What?!
So, did you do it?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
You wanna do it right now?
Great!
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
Thanks.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Really?
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Are you kidding?!
No!
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Uh-huh.
That sounds great!
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
You're pregnant!
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Hey! Hi!
Hey!
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Oh my God!
What?
Oh my God!
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
Is that a problem?
No.
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Come on baby, come on!
Very nice touch.
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
You never run on a barge!
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Uh-huh, I don't know.
Hey.
Hey.
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Sure, now I'm scared.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
I miss Rose.
Oh, yeah?
You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
Ok, that's so nice.
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.

Oh my God.
I know.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Why don't we do a trial run.
I'm the supply manager.
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Men are such idiots.
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Yeah.
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Oh!
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
Alright, I can get you out.
What?
I think I need a drink.
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Oh, how bad is it?
How's your room Rach?
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Well, I was having a conversation.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
That would be great. Thank you.
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Oh my God! That's David!
David who?
Oh my God!
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Ross? Let's go.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
In this life, Phoebe.
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Women are mean!!!
Hey.
Hey! How was it?
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Like what?
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
Okay, is there anything else?
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
Phoebe!
Hey!
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
No. Well, yeah, maybe.
What's 1922?
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Yes.
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
We had a characturist!
Oh!!
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
And yet, here we are doing it again.
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Pheebs, what are you doing?
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Okay, now I've really have to go!
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
Hi.
Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
What are these, stitches?
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
Hey.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
You see this, this is a friend.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Oh man!
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Why don't you just go out with her!
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Yeah.
Nothing at all?
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh-huh!
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Sorry.
What happened?
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
My chair heels itself.
Hey guy!
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Okay.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Yeah.
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
Really!
Oh my, would you look at that!
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
What?!
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Uh, no!!
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
So umm, where are the other guys?
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
Well that would help the pride thing.
Hey!
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
Uh-hmm.
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Phoebe?
Yeah?
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Feel better now?
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
What?
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
Damn! I am good at Cups!
I'm not talking to her!
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
I know, I took it hard too.
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Yeah-yeah.
Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
I'm getting married next!!
Yay!
Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
I guess.
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Hey!
Hey!
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.

Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
What about my friend Victor?
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
But I love swing music!
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Well, what is the other reason?
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Sure.
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Rrrreally.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Merry Christmas!
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Oh my God!
What?
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Who are you saying "check" too?
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Hey!
Hey!
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Ugh, I hate this year!
What's wrong with this year?
That was me and Ross.
Oh that's right!
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
But Phoebe...
Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
Oh!
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
I'm the ring bearer.
Oh my God, who died on this?!
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Monica!
Hmm?
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
Um, do you wanna sit?
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
You're saying, my wife is in you?
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
No! You should've read it yourself!
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Well then I think that's it.
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
Oh thank you.
Okay.
Hey!
Hi!
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
You?
How ya doin'?
I'm a twinkie.
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Ahh!
Hey now!
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
I know, I know. Hello.
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
What?
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
OK, let's do it. What?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
Oh, I love museums!
Umm.
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Another good point.
Huh?
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
If you want.
She's still with you?
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Really?! Well, when?
Wow.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Well believe it baby!
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
leave...
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
All right, so let's switch.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Our apartment is ready.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Bye, Pheebs.
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Aw, dammit!
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Well, back to square one.
Yes!
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Nothing, nothing.
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
Oh. They don't.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
No!
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
What are you writing?
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Not really.
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!
Fine!
Yeah!
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
How do you feel?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
And protected them from a tornado?
Oh my God.
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Hey! Look who I found!
Oh, hey guys!
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
What?!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Hey!
Hey!
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
What?!
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Keep talking.
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Are you serious?
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
No!!
Thank you Phoebe.
She didn't.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
No, women are welcome to play.
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Oh! That's fine.
Great! Okay, good for you!
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Oh hey! How was your audition?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks.
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Yeah, all right.
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
You didn't get the money, did you?
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Come on along and listen to...
Okay, Widow!
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
Yeah.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Yeah.
I can.
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Hi! Phoebe.
Hi Phoebe.
No we...
Hormones.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Oh. They don't.
What?
Intense and creepy.
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
I can give it a shot.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
Hey.
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Destiny.
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
What?
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
What?
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Oh.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
Okay, I'm ready.
Oh, aaaah!
What are you supporting?
Duh!! Christmas!
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
No. No, that's- that's okay.
That guy's going home with a note!
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Okay.
So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
How close?
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
You got it.
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Wow, you worked in a mine?
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
You don't have the guts.
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
This is great!
What's the game?! What's the game?!
They're green?
Good! Good! Five points!
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Really!
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
I don't want a ghost.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Oh.
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Okay.
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
Again, it's not that he...
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Yeah.
And she's back in the game.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Tony?
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Does anybody want anything else?
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Hey Rach!
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
Hey, Pheebs!
What are you reading?
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Jack!! Hey!
What are you doing here?
Well, you were fired.
Nu-uh!
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
She's still with you?
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
God!
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
How's the hair?
Can we see her?
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Oh yes.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Suck-fest.
Toootal chick-flick.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
There was nudity!
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Really?
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Uh-hmm.
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
Well it's not Sean Penn.
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
Phoebe's got another job, right?
Great set tonight Phoebs.
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
So you had fun, huh?
No.
Hey.
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...


...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Well, people are different.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
I'm actually the office manager.
Well, was there anything else?!
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
I mean really, think about it.
Ho-ho, I will.
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
So you're not homesick yet?
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
Ow! Ow!
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
I promise.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Why don't you just go out with her!
Awesome!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Yeah.
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Oh thank you.
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Ohh.
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Definitely not his mother.
Oh, no...
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Light still out?
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Where did you get that?
Phoebe?
Hm?
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Rachel, get the book! The book!
Okay! Okay! Here!
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
On the touchy.
And that's not against your oath?!
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
All of them.
Oh yeah, so you know D?
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
No. I've learned my lesson.
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Rachel?
Yeah.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
Oh my God. What happened?
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
Oh cool! You made him cry!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Why?! Why not?!
What did you say to him?
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Uh.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
They're your backup singers... beind you.
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
What?!
Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
What kind of an emergency?
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
You won't let go?
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Help! Help!
Help!
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Okay.
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
What's your point?
PBS telethon.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
What?!
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Maybe she never got your message.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Yes!
Pheebs, that's great!
Oh, yay!
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
No.
Give it.
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
What?
Ross says hi.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Oh my God!
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
I'm sorry.
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
You don't drink.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
Excuse me.
Your pants!
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
What?
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
No.
Does it look like an ashtray?
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Are you kidding me?
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
No! No!
No, no?
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Oh!
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Well, h-how is this like that?
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
What one?
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
All right, that's it, I quit.
What? I didn't say anything.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
I don't know! I don't remember!
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
What?
Oh yeah, like you never called!
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
That's what you think.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
What was her name?
Nesele Toulouse.
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Can I help you?
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Yeah, okay, Scott!
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Y'know, I never saw that.
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
This is Rachel.
Yeah, OK.
It's a lovely apartment.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Yeah?
What?! No!
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Um... hi there.
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Yeah, yeah!
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Your mother told you this?
Yes!
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
See he's nice. Right?
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
I saved you a seat.
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
What?
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
Really?!
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Just a bug.
Okay.
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Okay whatever.
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
So you watched the movies huh?
Charlotte who?
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Why? Do you have a report due?
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
Cups? You're giving me cups?
And ice!
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
I got it! Mine!
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
I think that's gum.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Why aren't you at home in bed?
I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
Ohh, ohh.
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
What's this?
This is the coolest house ever!!
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Hey, how, how did you do that?
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Ross.
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Would you look at them?
Yeah, can't help but.
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Anybody want a croan.
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
No, I don't.
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
Yeah?
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Really?!
Thank you.
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Ooh, I look good.
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
She was?
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Have you seen your guy's body?
No, our guy is just a floating head.
You're not supposed to look!
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
So do them for free.
They make you take an oath?
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
What about him?
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Excuse me?
Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
Huh.
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
Phoebe.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
You want me to see a therapist?
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Well, we are great guys.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
Honey, I'm sorry.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
You love me!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
What am I sitting on?
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
I know!
Not at these prices.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Hi!
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Like what?
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
And Monica, what are you going to make?
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Huh.
What did you tell them?
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Phoebe!
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
You mean like, music?
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
All right.
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Ooh! Hi!
Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
Yes.
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
Awwwww...
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Monica's wasted.
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
Hey.
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
Good.
Oh, thank God.
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
I had the same dream!
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
It does not!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Absolutely! Absolutely!
This is so much fun!
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Aaawwwwww!!
What happened?
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
Okay.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
Cat hair.
Oh, sorry.
Hey.
Hey.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
What?! Excuse me!
Oh hi!
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
What?!
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
Slides are almost ready.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
What's the matter?
So do them for free.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
And all these people actually died?
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
Give it here. Oh, God.
Okay.
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
You mean like a doctor?
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Did that!
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was it not pain-free?
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
You're saying, my wife is in you?
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
Everything?
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Well, at least you scared someone.
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
All right.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
Hey!
Hey!
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
I stepped in something icky.
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Like what?
Okay.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Sorry Phoebs.
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
And then he did.
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
No, women are welcome to play.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
So what're you going to do?
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Um... hi there.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
They know you know.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Ahh.
His indian name?
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
It was unbelievable!
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Oh, it ended very well.
Oh.
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
Right.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
What is it doing here?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Shut up, I'm happy.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Ok.
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Pheebs...
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Yeah, alright.
Alright. Phoebe?
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Men just take out wind?
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Oh, just ask him!
Me?!
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
You're right.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
Sure.
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
I'm, I'm still me.
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
A couple of bucks.
Wow!
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
No kind. He just makes it up.
So how's it going with you guys?
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Ah!!
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
What are you doing?
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
This will just be my batch.
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
What?
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay, these things happen.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
You al-you already had it?
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
We ruined everything.
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
Well I. . .
Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
Here we go.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Sure!
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Hey!
How was the beach?
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Ughh!
Thank you so much Phoebe.
Sure.
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
Huuh.
Yeah, I know, I.
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
So how long have you known?
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Okay, I think I got it.
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Dude! That's my sister!
Give me that!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Enh. Sure!
I wonder how long that milk has been setting out.
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
I wish all guys could be like him.
I know.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Every night!!
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Hi Frank.
Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
You can spill. In the sink.
I love you, too.
Aww, good. What?
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Hey!
Hey.
Fascinating.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
I can't believe you did that!
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh.
What?
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Hey!
Hey!
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
What did you say to him?
Could everyone please take their seats?
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
Ohh!!
Yes!
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Yeah, all right.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
What?!
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
No, 'cause he's yummy.
Yes. But all the other ones.
Anybody want a croan.
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
What is it hon?
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
What time?
What does it say?!
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
...What shoe?
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
No! Ooh! Oh my god!
The Waltham Residence.
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Good luck, honey!
Bye!
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
There's more beer, right?
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
14.
Hit me!
Stop it!
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Hang up, hang up.
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Oh God.
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Arrrghh!!
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Yes!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
Hold on.
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
'Kay, here you go.
What is this?
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
So, how was the party?
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
It worked!
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
Hey!
Hey.
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Oh, it's gonna be fine.
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Thank you.
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Do you?
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
Oh my God.
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
Woo-hooooo!!!!
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
All right, I got 48.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
His new girlfriend!
What is that?
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
And all these people actually died?
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
Really?
Yes.
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Ennnh.
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
There are seven?! That's one?
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Hey!
Hey!
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
Y'know what that means?
That you're actually 50?
Oh!
That is so cool.
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
Charlotte who?
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Yeah.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Oh my God.
I know.
Pretty uhm, different huh?
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
I'll never forget you.
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
There y'go, kids.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
Hey!
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Nothing.
Nothing?
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
Good.
Oh, thank God.
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Yes. Not out loud.
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
No-no-no-no-no.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
I would love it if I weren't here!
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
I guess it was kinda funny.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Who's Elaine?
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Yes that was a nice place!
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Yeah.
We'd love too.
Well hello!
Where have you been?
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Hmm, how about my azzz?
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Oh!!
That's pretty much it.
Oops!
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Oh, great. This is just...
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
To pay for the gym.
Hey.
What?!
You got fired?!
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
She's here.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
So am I!
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Y'know...
I like it.
Gunther, kiss me.
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Really?
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Hey!
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
You're dying?!
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Okay, that's enough honey!
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Thank you. All right.
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Okay.
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
I know! I know! I know!
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Aww, I don't want to see that!
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Count for what?
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
After what I did? Can you blame her?
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Now calm down Joey.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Nope, not knocked up yet.
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I don't think there's anything.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Hey!
How are you?
You got to go on a ride along?!
Uh-huh!
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Hi, Ursula.
Hey!
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
You know her?!
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
Ok.
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
Taxi.
Bye you.
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
Yeah.
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
I gotta friend named Mark.
That'll work too.
Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
Yeah
You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Huh.
What did you tell them?
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
What have I not told you?
What!
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
Yes.
Well, how did you find out?
So what're you gonna do?
Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Left.
Damnit!
Looking up?
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Uh, ow.
I'll never forget you.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
Oh, ew!
What?
What, wait, you mean like this?
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Phoe-be!!
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
Ready?
No, you've got to whip it.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
What?!
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Honey, don't bite your nails.
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
A tad.
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Ok, Phoebe.
Such as?
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Phoebe, listen...
You lost 13 million dollars.
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Oh, well no problem there.
Easy Lenny.
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Sorry, Pheebs.
Yeah. You okay?
Yeah.
We'd love too.
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Hi!
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
U-N-I-sexy?
Hi sweetie!
Hey, how are you holding up?
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Yes, yes I was.
It really says that?!
Yeah. See?
No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Oh God, Phoebe!
I'm talking about massages.
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
Well, what period is it from?
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Yeah but Phoebe...
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
I'm fine, thanks.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Oh, fine! Take his side!
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
OK.

I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
That's what you think.
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
What?! Ow!
Beep!
Don't interrupt me!!
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
What is it?
It's Hexadrin.
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
Oh.
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Hey! So I'm back.
Who are you?
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Is anybody else scared?
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Oh, now you want a pad.
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Hi!
What's the matter?
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
That you don't stop talking about it.
Fine.
What're you doing? Are you scratching?
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Ahh-hahaha!
Ha!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
Tequila!!
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
I'm not asking!
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Ok.
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
What's up?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Ooh.
What?
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Great!
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
No, I'm sorry.
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
Thanks! So are you.
I told you I should not wear this color.
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
That's right.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Honey that sounds like fun.
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
What are these, stitches?
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Hey!!
Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Yes!!
Yes! She's very excited about that.
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
Ross, I know what you're thinking.
What?
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
What?!!
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
What?
Then, I don't get it.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
What?!
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Oh, ah with who?
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Actually, it looks really good.
Get in here!!!
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
It's James Bond.
Sorry we're late.
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
Hi, Pheebs.
Bye, Pheebs.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
For Ross.
For Ross, Ross, Ross.
Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.

He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
Your eyes are very pretty.
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Hey!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Central... Park!
Yeah, all of us! All day!
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Ohh.
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
That is so unfair!
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Really?!
Oh well, where is he?!
Totally familiar.
Oh, yeah.
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
Hey!
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
All right.
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Ohh.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Are you the cutest?
I'm afraid I might just be.
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
It could be like a big giant guy.
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Hi!
Hi!
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
They make you take an oath?
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
Yes, yes I was.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
I'm all better now.
I helped!
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Some moms do that.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
OK, that's my tattoo.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
You got a tattoo?
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Jason?
Yeah, come on in.
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Oh that's great!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
You do?
Yeah.
Hey.
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Oh, she's gonna love that!
I don't have anything.
Hey listen man, about the stripper...
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
Okay, bye.
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Oh hey!
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
Hello.
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Here you go.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
You didn't break up with that fireman?
Wow!
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Then, I don't get it.
They do?
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
None.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
Oh yeah!
No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
So, what do you think we should do?
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
God that is good TV.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Really?! Are you sure?
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
Really?!
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
What?
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
Okay.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
Thanks.
You always said I'd make it.
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
What? What? What?
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Oh.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
All right.
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Why, do you write him a lot?
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
Yeah!
Well, why would she lie to you?
Ohh!!
Yes!
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
Oh my God!
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
How do you feel?
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Really?! How much?!
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing-Why?!
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Yes!
Peanut butter!
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
Hey!
Hello! Hello!
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
I can't do that.
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
Uhh, yeah.
We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Do you want a refill?
No, I'm alright, thanks.
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
I'm Gail.
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Who?
Oh my God, Phoebe.
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Ooh-ho-ho!
14.
Hit me!
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Yay!
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Oh, just ask him!
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Like what?
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Hello!
Hey, what's that?
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Sorry, it's not.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
OK, here goes.
Are you going to do it?
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Well why didn't you take the job?
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Ross?!
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
They're brother and sister!!!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
Not for you.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Kick save and... denied.
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Ahh.
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Phoebe!
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
This is my favorite part.
Yeah me too.
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
What?
Ssshh.
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
All right, look at my on the back page.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Well, h-how is this like that?
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Yeah.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Oh.
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.

...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Why would you say that?
You're good. You're good!
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Go for it.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
Hi!
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
Yeah. See?
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
What?!
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
Did you like it?
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
Hey.
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
What? Me having a job?
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Really?
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
What are you talking about?
I can't belive it.
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Wait!
I don't ever want to see you again!
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
What's 1922?
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Hey.
Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
And what are you going to do for him?
I'm going to let him.
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Cool, thanks.
You okay?
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Everybody knows!
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
Just for a second.
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Maybe he's. . . gay.
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
That was so lame.
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Um. yeah.
I am soo dead.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Some moms do that.
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Yeah, okay.
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
I don't know.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
Oh!
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Hey what?
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Excellent!
Very informative!
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
No!
So it's just your mother then.
I don't need any toner.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
Hey guys.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Well, it does.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
They're brother and sister!!!
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
What?!
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
What?
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Because you're marrying him!
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
Yeah! Right!
Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Hangs up.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Yeah!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Dude, you soooo need this car.
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Right, why do you keep saying that?
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
Hey!
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
I am not!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
No Phoebe I am mad!
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Oh my god!!
Hey!
Hey!
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
What?! Why?
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Yeah!
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Well relax, he'll be here.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Ye-e-es!!
Hey.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Hey.
Hey.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
You really think it would be that different?
Well, things change.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
Because she's your lobster.
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
Hey, you feelin' better?
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
No, look.
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
Oh, we just...
Surprise!
Did you see Betty?
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What, what, what?!
You really think that is what he meant?
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...
Ok.

Thanks, Ross.
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
I got no sleep last night!
Why?
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Thanks.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Good luck!
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
I was thinkin' about it.
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
What's going on?
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Well, so why not go knock?
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Sweety...
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
Really?!
Uh, no!!
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
So umm, where are the other guys?
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Hey, you guys!
Hey!
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
So, I hear, you hate me!
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
Y'know, I never saw that.
Ooh, it was only okay.
Hi!
Hi!
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
She wants to meet you in person.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
Okay, I'll do it!
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Uh-huh.
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
Oh!
That is so cool.
Yeah! Yeah, we can!
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
What did they do?
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
We're with you. We got it.
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just...
Thanks!
Uh-huh.
Phoebe?
What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Yes. Not out loud.
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Rach?
I'll be out in a second.
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
There you go!
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Definitely.
Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
What do you know?!
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
You shouldn't.
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
I thought it was toner.
Really?!
Yes.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Hi!
So you like the short hair better.
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
You're actually going through with this?
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
Really?!
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Do you?
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
That's what I said.
Well so?
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
I stepped in something icky.
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
How is it you?
Yep, that's my audition.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
What?!
What?!
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
No.
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Oh I just miss him so much!
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
I know it is the best.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Whoa! Big octopus.
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Ugh, what's right with them?
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
None the less.
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
Okay.
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Ah, the other Jack.
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Yeah, sure.
Someone in there?
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Hey everyone!
Oh hi!
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Oh, thanks.
What are you doing?
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
Alrighty. From the top.
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Wow.
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Um-hum.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
No.
So uh, how you doin'?
Hey there you are!
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Well, so why not go knock?
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Yeah?
Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
So, um, have you told your parents?
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
I love you Phoebe.
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
What?
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Hey Mon!
Hey!
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Say what?
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Why?
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Yeah, I've been around.
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Great! Problem solved!
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
What?!
All right. All right.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Morning.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
And a glass of tepid water.
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
OK, hi again.
Hi Phoebe.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Really?!
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Hang up, hang up.
Is anybody else scared?
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Yes.
Yeah, Susan.
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
Uh-huh.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
What?!
Also Monday.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
Okay, I'll do it!
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Hey!
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
I never had a bike of my own.
What?!
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Ohh.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
It is so good to see you!
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
It's up to you.
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
Hi, I'm Karen.
I wanna quit the bank!
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.
Hey. I was...
Hey!
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
Hi.
Hi.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Including me?
Oh yeah.
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Yeah.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Yeah? That's so nice!
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
where were you standing?
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Phoebe! You can't do th...
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
So, did you pick one yet?
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Very nice touch.
Unbelievable.
Thank you so much.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
I can't believe you caved.
What?
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Hey, Pheebs.
What bank is this?
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Well thanks.
Not really.
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Well, but Pheebs.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
What?
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?
Thank you so much.
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Let it go!!
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Umm, okay.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
What?
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Hey!
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
What?!
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
Uh-huh, I don't know.
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
So! He'll understand!
God, you are so strong.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Hi!
Hi.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
And what did he say?
Wow.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Uh, ow.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Okay, Widow!
...the lullabye of...
All right. I'll get my bag.
Good.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Bye.
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Who cares? I repel women.
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
No.
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Thank you.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
All right, you ready?
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Oh, honey.
What do you mean?
I think it went into me.
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
Enough!
Lean-lean-lean!
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Oh I know!!
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Nono, she's gone.
We checked. A lot.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Thanks!
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Yeah, I don't know.
What's the matter?
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Hi Phoebe.
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
Yeah it is. . . what?
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
Ssshh.
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
This is so great.
You wanna explain that?
Where are they?
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
I can't believe you caved.
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Ready?
Uh-huh. Good luck.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
I know.
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Can't wait.
Come on, they're gonna love you.
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Rach!
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Hey! It's Porsche!!
Hey!
How do you feel?
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
Yeah, get out! Now!
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
