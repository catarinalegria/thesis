Isabella Rosselini.
Um, coffee to go, please.
Joey?! Joey!!
I was just getting him to like you.
Peach pit.
What?
Rachel!! Monica!!
Don't interrupt me!!
Turn! Turn!
Okay.
It could happen.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
What do I do now?
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
Hey, it's my list.
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
This is not fun!
This is so much fun!
Oh no, not yet.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Oh, that's not cool.
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
You get the dollhouse.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Is everything ok?
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Hey, is Chandler here?
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Who am I?
Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
Well, last weekend...
How long has it been since you had sex?
What?! How's that?
Well it's gone.
I'm going to the bathroom.
I told ya.
What happened? Joey?
Come on!
Duh, you think?
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
And so do I.
I care!
I'm so sorry ...
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
What did you get?
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Hey, where's Rach?
Hey.
Hey Chandler. Monica!
Ross?
You really didn't know?
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
Come on! Here.
All right!
No, I don't think so.
All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
Look, look, look.
What?
Oh, it's not over!
And that's not all I'm allergic to.
OK, here goes.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Tell me about it.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
You talked to her?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
NO! I don't!!
It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
No, we're not!!
Yeah, we are.
I gotta get to work.
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
I wasn't talking to you.
Yeah I think so.
I don't get a goodbye?
THE HELL I DO!
An egg?
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Close. Ron.
Oh right, uhm, Don?
Everybody smile.
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
Hot dog?
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Kristen Lang.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
May 12th?
Care to venture a guess?
Practical jokes.
What's not funny?
Wh... wh...what?
No, I'm still going.
Yes!! Yes!!!
Weee!!!
Zoo dollars?
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
That's a good point.
That's 'cause you have it.
Here it comes.
Wow!
Well, start looking.
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Yeah, okay, Scott!
I'm Scott.
I'm gonna tell Mom.
You're gonna what?
You still love me?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Well, I guess that's it.
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
Hey, where's Rachel?
Where?
Eh, no problem.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Please be kidding.
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Did you say something?
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Wh-what's going on?
WHAT?
What's-what's going on?
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
What did it say?
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
Pop it in.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
He'll be fine.
That's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
Aww, come on.
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Pheebs, what's wrong?
Hi!
See, I told you!
Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
You okay man?
You did it, man.
Oh my God.
Thanks! Thank you!
You got it!
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Who is Maria?
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
You and your ice.
I'll be right back.
Blueberry it is.
Blueberry.
It's not a library...
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
I can't think of anything.
Please, I think you know why.
I didn't get the annulment.
Always.
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Yes?
Yeah, it really was!
Wow. Good speech.
Uh-huh, I see that.
How's it gonna be all right?!
How's the maniac?
Hey.
Why are you laughing?
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Sure, what's up?
I need to talk to you!
I don't know. Soap?
What kind of smell?
Challenge excepted.
Deal!
Challenge extended.
Six.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
Dear Lord!!
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Die Hard!!!!!!
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Linen closet.
The burping clogs?
Meth-methane smells...
Oh the humanity.
October 18th.
Sure, May...tember.
Ohhh! Kids!
I like Ross.
Ready sweety?
Ok.
Second date!
Yeah, there you go!
You'd wait?
I'd wait.
Oh, oh Chandler...
I don't sound like that.
Come on, tell me.
Nothing.
Give me two.
One hour.
No, it's a concept!
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
Look I told you...
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
At the vet.
Where've you been?
Oh my God! Monica!
Honey, it isn't good luck.
Hey, where's Chandler?
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Yeah, they don't like you.
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
I'm up for tenure.
Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
That would be nice.
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Come on, seriously.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
We're so lucky.
She's perfect.
What-what do you mean?
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Come on! Joe!
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
Yeah? How much?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
About the yelling.
Right.
Okay Rach, but...
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Whaddya got there?
Oh.. you don't get it!
It's too cold.
You don't like ice cream?
I'll take sports.
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
You're not going to go.
I'm not gonna gooo.
I'll be right down.
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
Okay! Hey Tommy.
Thanks!
Oh, I love that guy!
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Just, y'know out.
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
In your mouth?!
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
What, what oh....
Honey.
Helps a little.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Wha... what, here?
No no no. Talk... dirty.
I'd love to!
Sure!
What are you guys doing?
I gotta get one, too.
Yeah, okay you're right.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Yeah, make that three.
Yeah, me too.
You're excited, right?
YAY! WHOO! YAY!
Something about hi.
What did he say?
I'll take that dad.
Found it.
Where in Cuba?
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Okay, why are you here?
Because a car backfired?
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Diet soda.
She is a kook.
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Now, we'll see.
Okay.
Well, hello Rachel!
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
So, what? That's it?
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
Yeah, you didn't get one.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
It's breast milk.
I licked my arm, what?
What happened you guys?
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
It was a hug!
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
Yeah, what's going on?
Well, what is the truth?
I don't see why not.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
So, uh, he's back.
I do Raquel.
Why are they here?
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
It's a great class.
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
Hey, hi, hi!
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
The big apple!
New York.
I think he can be.
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
You're not a lefty?
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
Oh, I missed you too.
Hey! I missed you.
Not even once.
Not even one more time?
No. Now maybe.
Did they just kill off Joey?
Well, now I do!!
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
What's goin' on?
No suds, no save. Ok?
Wha, uhh, what?
OK, gook luck.
Yeah, I know the type.
You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...
Come on. I got it.
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Monica! Would it?
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Sure. Why not?
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
"Heating device."
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
'My scones.'
My scones.
...Valentine's day...
You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
...What shoe?
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
A-a-and... record.
Yeah.
Aqui est.
hey, fella! How you doing?
Buy mommy.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Chloe? Hi..
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
Oh my God!!
Er.... um.....
Say something..... hot.
Lucky sixes....
Wow.
Mitzi is.....
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Mmm hmmm.
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Multiple orgasms!
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Must pee.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Ni-chou chi-ma!
Alright!
Quack, quack..
Thanks.
Sweep, sweep....
Right.
Toilet paper?
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
Total wuss!
What a baby.
YES, YES!
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
It's ok. I'm sorry.
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
Which one was that?
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Well ah, actually...
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
No, no he's not.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
That guy Lipson?
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
There he is!!
Is that my ass?
Oh, wake up!
Emily's straight.
Hey, what's going on?
Oh, hi.
A little bit.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Get to the problem!
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
Because, it's weird!
So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
Why did you do that?
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Uh... to the bathroom.
Excuse me, where are you going?
I would never do that!
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
Oh-no. No. No.
Will you marry me?
Before the snap!
After the snap!
What's-what's the difference?
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Is this about Mark?
Well neither do I!
I'm not going to do that.
Uh-huh.
Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
You guys, he's beautiful!
I can't believe this!!
Come on!
The small one.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Pheebs, what are you doing?
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Here's my retainer!
I don't see why not.
Yeah, he can do it!
I'm telling ya... I can do it.
Yeah, which was nice.
You cuddled.
I think Chandler's gone.
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
I... I don't know..
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Oh, I'll have some!
Who wants French toast?
How 'bout Ben?
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
Yes. Yes I do.
So you want to come inside?
No! You let go!
Let go!
You like that do ya?
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
No, no, no, but...
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.
You really think so?
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
I know, it's pretty great.
Oh my God. You and Rachel?
Ah, Rachel I guess.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Your good friend?
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Okay! All clear!
No. No.
Good! That's good!
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
I knew that was him!
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
How is that important?
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
Wow, it really is!
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
No, no, I knew .
Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
Ahh, no, I'm good.
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
Press the button.
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
So uhh, you ready?
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
We're late too!
What are you doing here!
Again, very sorry.
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Right, no, I understand.
That's because I'm pregnant!
Thank you, thank you.
All right.
Oh you do, do you?
I know what your problem is.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh Ross, hi.
You look pretty tonight.
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
I'm not gonna hit you.
You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
Hey Joey. Hey you.
Uh... Look Rach... Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Is-is he ok?
I'm so sorry...
Just please stop!
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Nice to meet you.
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
Okay, the thing is..
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
I do. I do. I do.
Okay.
Hey! Hi Bonnie!
Hey!
Wow! What a pleasure.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
Um, everyone?
Oh, yeah, why not?
I'd rather not.
Move in with me.
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
There's no seatbelt!
Good luck, good luck!
Oh, I am very in.
Ross?
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
Yeah, I know but...
All right, see you guys.
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
Hey, I need a ticket.
Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
You sure you're alright?
Hmm-hmm.
Good one, Rach.
I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Buddy, my monkey?
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
I swear to God...!
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
That's a little clearer.
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
I was thinkin' about it.
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
Come on! That's great.
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Althea is correct.
You're shooting with Althea?!
It wasn't the best.
Well that was umm...Okay.
So you two are..?
Ross, say something. Anything.
There's an image.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
I'm not a nice guy.
...Yeah?
My uncle Marcel.
Marcel?
Monica? You're Mom.
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Hi, is Rachel there?
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
No, no, we won't.
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
How could I forget?
Ross, you remember Susan.
You broke the pact!
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Oh yeah, why not?
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Great to see you!
Ross!
And it can't be Joey.
Done!
Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
Not nice enough.
All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
Now she's passed.
This almost never happens!
How about all the way.
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
I broke my thumb.
Hey, so how is it?
Who's your roommate?
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
Hey, here's a thought.
What?!
Ok, dinner's on.
Well that wasn't easy.
Juice, I need...
Listen to me!!
I don't know what to say.
Okay.
Ohio!! Thank you!
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Okay, see ya later.
You got it.
what's up, Dad?
What the hell!!!
Oh, no no, I am.
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
Oh, forget it, okay?
Ross.
That'd be good...
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Yes it is.
I don't know Rachel, why?
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Nono, she's gone.
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
That's what I'm telling you.
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
Hey!
Give me the bag.
No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
That is so unfair!
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
You okay there, slugger?
Good for a scrud.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
I never gave it to you.
Ross?
Yeah that's the same.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Well, you can help me!
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Oh, who? Me?
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Do you have a point?
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Okay, good-good for you.
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
They put that in.
Yeah.
Umm, she kissed me.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Come on, it's fun!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
No, I can't get it out.
What?
Let's show 'em.
Ahh, are you hadsome.
Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Whoa!!
Really? Which one?
Great!
Yeah! Let's go out.
Yeah! I'll cook!
Here, go nuts.
Yeah.
Yeah, a real pleasure.
Ross, nice to meet you.
Yeah, that'll do it.
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
Dude, what are you doing?
All right buddy, way to go!
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
I am very...very sorry.
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
All right, there you go!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
All right, I'll do it.
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Is that what I want?
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Ohh, I don't think so.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
You can live with me.
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
Rachel! Rachel Green!
I don't see her.
Dad, what are you doing?
I can't say that I'm surprised.
It's morphin time!
Sorry.
Hey, don't we have to...
Okay, listen Robert...
Yeah I just hurt it.
It's not cooler.
I gave them to Joey.
I lent them to Ross.
It was you, pal.
God?
Of Ross and Rachel.
Ross of.....
Sorry. . You ok?
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Ohh, what's wrong?!
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Well, you have fun tonight.
That's what I was doing too.
We're looking into it.
She may have died?
Neither will I.
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
No, but. . .
Ross, there is no us, OK.
Not at the concert.
Together.
And, I love you!!
I hate you!!
What? Let me see.
Chandler's wearing panties.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
Okay. Okay.
Dude, we were good!
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Yes, yes, you did.
N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
Obviously not to Joey.
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Oh my God. I mean...
Yeah?
All right, see you later.
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
You wanna explain that?
This is so great.
Well, they're not mine!
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Really?! We are?
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
We've got presents!
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
We can't do it again.
I want to do it again.
What guys? Oh, yeah.
I can't believe the guys missed this.
Come on, let's go!
Are you okay?
When did I say that?
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
What am I going to do?
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Phoebe that's not true.
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Hey! You were so right!
Oh, hey!
Well, Mon, I was married.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Dude, you are sick.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
So this is your office?
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
Come on, don't do this.
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Oh, she isn't home.
What-what about Monica?
Joey proposed to you?
Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
Oh, sorry we didn't know.
Hey you're in our seats.
Yeah. What do you think.
Really.
What are you talking about?
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
It was just a kiss.
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Hey, how's it going?
Hey.
I bet two dollars.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Well, that makes sense.
A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
Yeah, but don't you think....
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Alright, I want my monkey.
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Seriously... What is it?
Nothing...
So how'd it go?
Mmm.
No! No we don't!
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
I just wanna check something.
Why?
Okay, here we go...
No, no, no, no!
People can hear you.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Okay, you go grab it!
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
C'mon, it's my birthday.
Oh Jack stop.
Uh, I don't know, whatever.
He does that?!
Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Show them to me!
No..!
Oh, I promise, what.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
My God Monica!!
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
It was my first time.
What?
They're not a couple!
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Oh. This was amazing.
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Then I'm happy too.
Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
Huh. This is nice.
Are you Joey?
You, you go long.
Wait, what am I gonna do?
What was with the dishes?
Hey, I've been honing!
So what are you gonna do?
Nothing!
I'm so proud of you.
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
You are totally jealous.
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Is everything allright?
Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
Honey, I love you too.
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
Pretty cool, huh?
Hey, all right!
I don't think that we are.
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you're gonna get together right?
I'm the ring bearer.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
Why would I tell him?
So are you gonna tell him?
You ate my sandwich?
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Show me where?
Y'know, there's two women dude.
How'd did it go?
Hi.
You took my watch?
Is this about me taking your watch?
Can you say Barbados?
Mmh-mmh.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh.
What the? What...
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
Mmm. Oh, no-
Goodnight.
Oh, hi Chloe.
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
Oh my God. Congratulations.
Monica and I are engaged.
Okay sorry, whew.
None for me.
May I come in?
Hey.
Go, go, go!
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Really? Wh-what's wrong?
Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
Sure. I'll help you.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
You were in a porno?
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
People need juice!
Look man!
I am a good kisser.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
She does want to.
Oh, she does want to.
Dude! That's my sister!
Look!
Men. I guy I know.
Who are these men?
Well that I can believe.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Check again please!
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Yeah, can't help but.
Would you look at them?
Okay, it's not a contest.
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Tsz... NO! .
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Huh, I'm just saying...
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Um, just some presents.
What's in the bag?
OK, tip the man.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
Just go for it Chandler.
Yeah!
You don't believe in evolution?
Nah. Not really.
I-I, did that for you.
Yes. They're insanely white.
200 at least.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
Hey, let's not do this!
Really? Even more humiliating than.
Need some help?
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
Hi!
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Hi, Mrs. Green.
Oh hello, Ross.
You're not his godfather.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Oh my God, I love you.
Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
OK, now I'm nervous.
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
How hot is this?!
Thank you so much.
Ah, what good are you.
Colorado.
And his first name.
Well that's his last name.
Oh.. you don't get it!
You!
Gentlemen, you're pick.
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
That's... that's classic.
I have absolutely no idea.
Uh, oh-ho bye.
Good bye Ross.
I'm gonna be on TV!!
Hey.
Oh my God, what happened?
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
We know you're out there.
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
Don't toy with me.
Maybe.
What's she look like?
Woo-hoo, stuud!
Sure what kind?
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Storming out!
My marriage is over.
What happened? What happened?
I want to go to the bathroom.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Did I do something to you?
Center ice.
That's correct. Ladies?
Animals dressed as humans.
Yep! That's hilarious!
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Hello to the rest.
Hey, sweetums.
I'll make some calls.
Oh yeah.
What-what is love really?
You love her!
You tell them to wait!
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
What kind of problem?
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
What kind of research?
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
You take care Jill.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
We're fine, we're fine.
Hi! How are you?
Oh, I hate this story.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Department of Sanitation?
Guess who?
Joe I'm not kidding.
Hit me!
One more fight!
I don't know...
Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
Oh come on, not again.
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Okay! You take care!
Good. Bye!
Where ya goin'?
Morning.
What was, what was that?
Oops.
So were you in Nam?
Agghhh.
Well hello! I'm Ross!
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
I get it! Well, that's that.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
We are even, right?
Hmm mmmhm..
Hi. Mom. Dad.
Hey.
We'll give you Janice.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Chandler's gone again!
What's going on?
Yeah, losers talk!
Losers walk!
...As in Mouse?
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
Yeah, we went shopping!
No! They did!
What's that supposed to mean?
Ross!
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
How's my little boy?
Hi!
What? I don't get a goodbye?
Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
Well, I said it loud.
I heard that!
Okay, what does it mean?
Oh, but of course it is!
So, what are you gonna do?
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
And thank you, for that.
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
And we didn't have sex.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
...Now that was fun.
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
I do too! I do too!
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Right, is it painful?
Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
So uh, where's Monica?
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
How did he do this?
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
It was, it was okay.
All right! So, was it amazing?
Hey, how was the Met?
Hi!
Well, howdya feel?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Everyone, this is Julie.
What up?!
Okay, hold my crawler.
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
Really?! I mean, really?!!
Wow, it was so-wow!
Do you want me too?
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
She's still at dinner?
No.
I'm gonna call after you!
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Well, it matters to me.
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
What's her last name?
Yeah!
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Lift!! And slide!
Ross, I really don't think...
I don't know if it's true.
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Yeah, I'll take some.
Does anybody need more coffee?
Ohh, it was the best!
Hope you had a nice flight.
Wait a minute, look.
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Then what did happen?
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't...I didn't propose!
You got off the plane.
I got off the plane.
Oh, you've tasted it.
Uh huh.
Actually, no, we're not.
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
Okay. Well, you be careful.
No.
Hey, Fun Bobby!
Geller!
Hey, this- Heyy...
Any minute now.
Okay. But not about this!
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
You were at the coffeehouse!
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Oh, thank you so much!
It was really... great!
No, no. I-I'm good.
No one wanted seconds, right?
This is weird for me!
What? Why?!
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Wha... what do you mean?
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
No-o-o! No way!
Okay, who's next?!
You chipped in?!
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
...everyone, this is Chandler!
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
Are you sure?
I'm sure he'll understand.
But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
And that's funny, why?
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
I did not freak out.
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
What's that on the bottom?
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
So, Saturday night!
Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? . Yeah!
Well, the lighting was okay.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
We're just gonna be friends.
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
She's gonna be a scientist!
Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
What are you, a child?
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
I didn't order lemonade.
Here's your lemonade.
I am, uh, I am...
What are you doing out there?
I am gonna see her again.
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
My wife's a lesbian.
Hey, are you okay?
What, it's not your fault.
I know, yeah, sorry.
Eat your fish.
No, we can go to Williamsburg.
I think that would be best.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
Well, Ben would be there.
So it would just be, me alone?
You guys ready to go?
Hey!
Why did you hate me?
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Me too. Come here.
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
I just grabbed a spoon.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
So why don't you quit?
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
Joey, we just saw it!
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
The Geller Cup.
Because the winner gets this!
What the hell are you doing?
Or! You can just, y'know...
Hey-hey, what are those?
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Oh, mine's December...
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
How might you be wrong?
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Who's laughing now?
Ah.
So, what did you decide?
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
I don't know, something girlie.
So what are they doing?
They have another guess.
Ha-ha!
Is uh, is Monica here?
Hi!
About four hours.
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
What? Hey, hey, listen..
Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
What are you doing here?!
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
What's the matter? You okay?
Ohh...
I will give you a call.
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
No. I'm saying it's now.
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
I have sex with dinosaurs??
Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Okay, wish me luck.
Then why do you ask?!
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
I'm not supposed to tell you!
I'm not supposed to tell you.
Learn about Jesus...
You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Women really want this?
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
So we're a little late.
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
Uhh, hang in there?
The woman just vanished!
Still on Amelia Earhart?
There's other stuff too.
Well, we could do that!
Those are the pacts!
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
I'm sorry I didn't catch.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa.
Gimme back my monkey.
What about it?
Oh, okay. What-what about?
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
No, and I'm not going to.
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
And they knew about it?
What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
She's doing her laundry.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
What? No-no, a lurker.
M-M-Mole people?
Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
How does this look?
Oh!
Hey hey, can I help?
Uh huh.
Monica. Whaddya think?
Okay!
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
There you go. Thank you!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Yeah, of course, Donald.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
That cup is mine!
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
ON A CAT??!!!!
A thousand bucks.
Oh my God, you guys!!
What?!
So? What do you think?
oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
It is! It is!
Oh honey, but it is just about...
Yeah? How'd it go?
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
Of course, what happened?
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
What the hell was that?!
Okay, bye!
Dude, we got to talk.
Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
Also an island.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
We were on a break!
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
Wow! How are you?!
Alright, shall we?
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Awww, man! Really?
Chandler.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Nobody likes change.
Well, can you blame her?
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
She may have died.
What's going on?
Technically, huh, no.
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
So, can you trust me?
You're right.
Hi. She said yes.
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
That is what the thing is.
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Okay. Sometimes I feel...
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Please, you're going down!
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Okay, that's, that's enough.
'I drink tea.'
The screaming guy?
Oh my god.
Ah actually we don't.
Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
Oh God, here we go!
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
No, these are my pants.
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
Oh I a lot of stuff!
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Which one is Gina?
I mean, was it Gina?
No no no, go-
Sorry-
Oh, do you, do you really?
I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Oh, we have one too!!
I got that!
Nobody likes change.
Good different?
Well, not playing raquetball!
What're you guys doing out here?
Hi. Where is everybody?
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Yeah, that'd be cool!
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Hey, what's goin' on?
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Susan, go deep.
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
What, the word hi?
Ben just said hi.
Yep, can you believe it?
So I guess Rachel had you baby?
No but, no but.
Oh, I love you too. But...
Yes, very nice Rachel.
Thanks!
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
I'll say.
Oh just say it Kyle!
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
I want my turkey now!
All right.
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
What? Your-your list?
Your mother just added him to her list.
Sure, what do you got?
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
It so does not!!!
It does. It really and truly does.
Stopped for a Chunky.
You see what I mean.
I can't catch a break!
But, it's not raining.
Dude, you're not tanned.
Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Why am I not surprised?
I don't know.
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Oh God!
That's it, your doing great.
Okay.
Joey, give me the bag.
Hit me.
Okay, quick and painful.
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Get out of the cab!
What?
Sweetie, now I pick you.
Phoebe.
I told you about my daughter.
Ah, who is Emma?
Only way to fly.
Take the top down did ya?
I'm gonna use the cushion.
Yeah.
Aww, is it broken?
Hey.
She looks so small.
Mrs. Geller?
Good, 'cause I love you.
Fine, I will.
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Not broad backed!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
That is so made up!
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
At the coffeehouse, right.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
We already knew that!
Hey!
Good evening officer.
It's a different guy!
No, because your not upset.
No.
The button, the button.
Which one? Which button, Jack.
What the hell are doing?!!
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Oh yeah, I'd love that.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
Okay fine, now Ross...
I wasn't- I mean, I-
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
What? Is it the comet?
Come here, check this out!
How sad are we?
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
I'm reading your ad.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
She, she was different.
She was nothing compared to you.
What? What? What? What is it?
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Man... I... I'm sorry.
Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
And she just gave you this?
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Hey, where'd you get that?
I love this game!!
Don't blame the questions!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
I'm not getting you a muffin!
Hey, you know what might help?
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Ross gave it to me.
In this life, Phoebe.
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
Wow, that's-that's-that's incredible.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
It's an empty apartment.
What, what, what?
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh my God.
Is-isn't it the best?
Ohh! Me too!
Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
Huh? Oh, I got this--this!
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Ah, and where is Joey?
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
Excellent, that was excellent.
That was amazing!
Can I ask you somethin'?
What?
No, you let me fini...
No, let me finish.
Wow! You-you look great!
Hi Ben!
Geez! Are you ready?
Yeah?
Two, I think a two.
Puerto Rican.
Yep! That's my thing...
Not knowing when to shut up...
All right, we're gonna play.
Once!!
I don't think that's what this is.
Menstrual cramps.
Here So this was fun!
Me too!
I, uh, I'll go see.
We're looking into it.
My apothecary table!!!
Ohh!!
Emma's down for the night.
Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
You remember Janice, right?
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
I don't know. A month?
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Dr. Franzblau, hi.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
Thanks for being born.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Yeah, I want my money back.
Yeah.
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
That would be great!
Going out with who?
What?! You're going out with her again!
Here come some more...
It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
Oh! Ah. Aw!
It's me!
Okay. Hut! Hike!
Yeah.
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
Yeah, like I could lose it.
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Okay, break-up's still on!
What?!
Uh, you're not gonna win.
You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Yeah. What are we gonna do?
You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Everything okay in there?
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
I can handle the stick!!
Oh well...
That word was swans.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Oh hey, hey Mark.
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
I can't believe you hated me.
Duh-huh!
How could you tell her?!
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Yes, we have to tell her!
Do we have to tell her?
OK. I'm in my apartment...
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
No thanks. I'm 29.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Okay, okay, what's going on?
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Okay, okay take a guess.
...Come on! Why are we here?!
So, what's going on now?
That makes more sense.
I mean after tomorrow night.
Thank you. I...yeah.
I can't believe this is happening.
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
You should get some sleep.
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
He didn't get the goggles!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
And she's a little mannish...
Hi... I'm Sandy.
Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Really?
Monica said that did she?
But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
Let's give it a shot.
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Yes! Santa's coming!
So Santa's coming?
Oh my God, we did it!
Yeah.
I really thought she'd stay.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, now you want a favour?
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
Then tell him quickly.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Nope! Something else.
Ohhh!!
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Let's do it, come on!
I didn't know you knew about that.
Cool!
I just asked that girl out.
Hey!
Pretty soon I guess.
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Just the crab cakes.
Ooh...
Oh! What a game, huh?
Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
Ohh! That would be great.
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Yeah! Se vice?
Oh!
You're livin' the dream.
What?
Dude, what'd you have?
Bye! Thank God
No, this is pretty much it.
He doesn't do much, does he?
Don't make jokes now.
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Yeah, what's your point?
Oh man, this is hilarious.
What? I don't get it.
The test is ready.
I know.
Probably around gonorrhea.
When do you think we lost her?
Oh.. oh... oh.
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Im gonna be a father.
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
You know where Joey is?
Hi...
Pants off Bing!
Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
You mean, we-you and me?
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
We need more cards.
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Yeah.
Come on, two on one.
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
He looks so tiny.
Yeah. Oooh...
No, I've looked everywhere!
You didn't find her?
All right, try pedaling.
Well...
Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy.
Oh, Jack.
So, for the whole weekend?
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
Try the bottom one.
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Thanks. You ready to go?
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
I can't believe that didn't work!
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I don't think they saw us.
Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
What?
Oh, it's my new beeper.
What are you playing with?
No, we can go to Williamsburg.
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Are you out of your mind?
Are you crazy?
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
I came with Paul!
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Hi.
Oh, that's not what you want...
I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
You ah, wanted to see me?
Hi!
Hey, I was looking out for you.
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
Nice to see you.
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Even if he were... cornered?
So what, we just sit?
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
All right, I'll see you tonight.
Okay. Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
Hey! Happy birthday ...
Hey you guys!
In the death seat?!!
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
I got itI'm getting it!
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Yeah! All right! You go first.
Are we really in Montreal?!
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Oh, where are you guys going?
Op! We gotta go!
Can I see you for a second?
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
Is there somebody else?
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
E-except, except that what?
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
So, uh, how's she doing?
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
...I hate waste.
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Ross, wants a pajmena?
Really?
Yes, yes, that's right...
Ohhh!!!!
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Alright.
Oh. Crab cake?
I just had a rough night.
What a pity stay?
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
It was a dry day.
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
What am I looking at?
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
Are we off the bridge?
You can open your eyes now.
Yes it is. See.
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Dude, what am I gonna...
Joey, do you have a minute?
Gas? Wow! Intense.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
That's fine, I'll just wait!
Let's see!
So he hasn't called?
well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
What do you think you're doing?!
My God!
C'mon, what's his name?
No one.
She's not even here yet.
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Go, go, go!!
Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl.
Hey, there is uncle Joey!
I said it's still nap time.
Hey, do you have any gum?
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Oh, oh... maybe not you!
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
I don't think you have much choice.
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Sorry. Sorry.
You slept with my sister?
Oh no!
Sure, do whatever you want.
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Will you-will you please?
Yeah, and not a very good one.
How did you know about that?!
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Although I was married to her.
Susan and I live together.
You're gonna be an aunt.
Am not!
Hey! Are you ready yet?
Hey!
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
No! That's-that's my arm!
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Do not rush me!!
It's not that far! Just drop!
So basically all nuts?
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
Hello-dillillio!!
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Almost time for cake.
Can't do it, can you?
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
OK. Hold my board.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
You've sentenced him?!
Five years.
Oh, I'm threatened by you?
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
You gotta hear this story.
And the spitting?
Well then, what is it?!
First of all, it's on your ass.
Who the hell was that?!
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
Guess where they are?
Yeah, they're great seats too!
Look I was going to tell you!
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Really? That okay, that's great.
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Let go! Let go!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Oh really! Why is that?
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Yeah that's what she said.
Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
OH MY GOD!
I was the pile of coats!
I am a single parent.
Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?
How could you not tell us?
We came over as soon as we saw.
You're nose is bleeding!
What?
No, 10 is the highest.
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Hey. How did you sleep?
Hey.
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Still thinking about it huh?
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
FINE BY ME!!
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Yeah! Come on!
I'm getting married, to..day!!
Morning, Ross.
Uhh, those are tacos.
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
I really wish that you wouldn't.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
What's the part, Anti-man?
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Who cares, AND?
What happened?
He's taking her purse!
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
Hey. What was that all about?
Oh, you're so screwed.
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Hi, is Molly here?
Well, I have a PhD, so...
Wow, you catch on quick.
What did you do to my mom?
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
Long story, honey.
Where have you been?
That's alright. Listen, listen.
Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Totally and completely healthy!
What? What's on your shoulder?
I think on my shoulder.
What're you talkin' about?
What?
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
What?
Then don't do that, alright?
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
so how'd the date go?
seriously Gunther you should see someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE!
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
There we go. All better.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
You slept with another woman?
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Actually, it looks really good.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
W-oa ... Mommy!
Could you please get her attention?
Well, I'm so excited about this.
Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
There was never a good time.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
How could you have told her?
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
Yes, you can, very much.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
You're really not coming back?
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Big bullies!!
All right. Uhh, international.
Mine!
Great, how did it go?
I went.
What are you, what are you doing?
Awful, absolutely awful.
And that's Phoebe over there!
Oh yeah.
How'd the callback go?
Hey!
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
Why? Did you write it?
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
It'll be okay Joe.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
It's a day to be thankful.
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Who the hell is Jordie?
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
Some of your old stuff.
So, what's this.
I thought that was just a rumour.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
All right, here's the ring.
Hey!
Should we send something?
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
C'mon! This looks good!
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!
I've been back and forth.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
That's what you said last night.
I don't know.
Yes! We're getting married?!
Yes!
He does not look happy.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
Yeah, but you didn't.
It hurts my teeth.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
What... what you working on?
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Why are you mad at me?
Garfunkle.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Woah. Woah... Woah.
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
So, you're not going to Paris.
Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
I knew it!
Actually, it wasn't that close.
Well then I demand a recount!
And what is second prize?
Five dollars a box.
Joey, some people don't like that.
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Are you guys sure about this?
Yeah!
Hey, you wet my pants!
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Well that's ambitious.
From you? Yes, please!
Ross, you need some help?
I'll see you in the morning .
Wow. Ok.
I'm gonna have to give him up.
So what does this mean?
This place is really beautiful!
Oh you should, it's great.
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Green. To the green.
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
hey, fella! How you doing?
Oh, look, he's waking up!
A basket of mini-muffins.
Well what did you send?
What's wrong with this year?
Ugh, I hate this year!
I will, I will find him.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
That's, that's nice twice!
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Hi!
You wanna buy a car?
How hot are we?
You have to respect the sea!
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
He finally asked you out?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Hey, how are you holding up?
Hi sweetie!
That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Relax, I'll fix it.
Great.
You've had feelings for me?
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Oh. And how was the date?
Ahhhh.
Why aren't you guys dressed?
Hey, mister tux!
You need to get some sleep.
God, what is wrong with me.
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
I didn't give her that ring!
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Ross, sweetheart!
You're right, you're right, it is.
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
Again, it's not that he...
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Oh come on!!
Wow. What does that mean?
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Well, ??? think that's us?
Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now.
I'm in for fifty cents.
Check.
I'm pretty sure that it is...
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
I don't! I wanna be with her.
What?
I'm having a son. Um...
We already knew that!
They published my paper.
What?
Well, do you wanna marry him?
Phoebe, that's huge!
You don't have to shout everything.
It's All Relative!!
Divorced men's club.
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
And have you .. ed?
Yeah.
Open it, open in.
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
Unagi. I'm always aware.
What?!
I didn't say we were brothers.
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Joey, get out of the fridge.
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Look, I do not re-love her.
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Very good.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Yeah. Hate him.
So you two are really serious?!
Oh my God!!
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
Look at you! You're up!
Hey!
Nope, nope, that's it.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
No, no, let me finish.
Hey, you listen.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
So what do you want me to do?
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
That's what it seemed like.
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Y'know this ??? is incredible.
Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
I could, yeah, I can do that.
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Oh my God, is that still...
Oww!
You were trying to eat it!
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Ohh, these are pretty good.
No, just a Friday night.
Let her off the plane!
Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
Dysprosium.
I'm never gonna find love again.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Don't you have to be at work?
I thought I had to make the jokes!
Well, but, but. . .
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Oh, thank goodness!
Nono, that would be me again.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
All right. Okay, here we go!
Come on, Chandler.
No! Do you wanna hear it?
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Ok, Mom never hit.
Ah!
Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Thanks, Ross.
You are? Me, too!
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
I can't believe he didn't come!
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Hey.
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
Oh Hans.
Thing, yes. Thing.
Thing?
Wow! Happy Monica's night!
Hi!
Rach, he's not an ex-con.
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
. Good choice Ross.
No don't worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.
It's just a fur ball.
What's up with the simian?
So you do know a little English.
Si.
He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
What are you guys doing later?
Hey!
Cannot feel my tounge.
You burn your mouth?
We're really gonna do this, huh?
I can't promise anything.
Here's your girlfriend's button.
If you want it to be.
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
What?
And that wasn't fun for you?
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Great. So let's get going?
Och, god. Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.
No! No! That's-that's time-out!
Oh, that's not what it means?
You are way off, pal.
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
You two will have very hairy children.
Wait! It was my plan.
Mine!
I just can't see Chandler cheating!
I know. Gooooood luck with it.
Oh that is so great! That's...
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
And why wouldn't he get it?
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
Ok, use it in a sentence.
Yes you did, gleba is a word!
She's dating. She's dating.
Bye.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I saw it.
I think the check in is that way.
Ohh, it was the best!
What's - what's going on?
Just get out of here, okay?
Oh, what were the other two?
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
What, to blind my child?
It's my New Year's resolution!
Thanks, man, big help.
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Glad I could help man.
Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
...will be two months...
Oh that's not so bad.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
What? We're never gonna make it!
You have to get a ticket to get past security.
It tastes like feet!
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
Hey! It's starting to snow.
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
So . . . Welcome.
Bye.
And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
So I don't wanna be just anybody.
So?
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Oh! It's you. Hi.
I think just the annulment for today.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Damn super cuts!
oh it's just you have that look.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
If you hold a spider.
Well, if you think it would help.
No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.
Because, because I've got Ben.
I've got Ben.
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Wh-what did he say?!
Uh-huh.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Rach, I got a message from you.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Come on, show them to me.
I'm not telling.
What is the matter with you?!?
I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
I think you've got concussion.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
That's right! Wait no, Ben.
Yeah, little Eric.
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
...I really don't...
Damn, I forgot you were here.
1250.
Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
All right.
No touch! No touch!
No! Never! Never! Bye.
Okay. Um, how about these?
Wait! We need shoes!
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
You kids ready?
Yeah-no, just that last song.
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
I don't even know what that's for.
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
Sure, you want to go upstairs?
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
Man, I sure miss Julie.
Twice.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
I know.
No! I balanced my checkbook.
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
I have an oily T-zone!
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Dr. Green. How are you?
Baby. Ross.
OK, now, sit. OK.
Grape.
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Umm, your boxes are umm...
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Why do you care so much?
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
Yes, of course they like you!
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
How do you feel about all this?
ah-ha!
Um... uh.... vulva.
What?
Come on, you know they love you.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
So where are we going next?
Oh. Oh!
Wow, hello! You look great!
Whoa!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Nothing-Why?!
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Huh-huh, they already know it.
You mean the lully story?
I love it, when we share.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
I don't think mine likes me either.
I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
That said it was my sandwich?!
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Come on, they're gonna love you.
Can't wait.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.
All right. Feel good?
All right.
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Well, we should probably get going.
I know.
Alright, alright, let's do this!
That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
C'mon kid, let's go.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Pass it! Pass it!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
That's, that's funny. Change!
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
You called Animal Control?
See? I've even called Animal Control!
I know, and with the baby coming?
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!
What? A brain transplant?!
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
...since I stopped trying.
That is.
Whoa! You had sex today?
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Did you really hear a bear?
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Oh no! An asteroid!
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
No more falafel for you!
What? What are you gonna do?
Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Uh. Did you call your parents?
Oh. And what do you call that?
I have a little comb.
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
With you?! Yeah right!
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Well, that's cool. So did...
Oh! No, not really.
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
It's just I miss her so much.
Okay.
But you already told me everything.
Maybe.
You're good. These are not.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Looks like a fun gang.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Does it always, uh--?
I did.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
I don't understand what just happened here.
I'll get it. Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking. It's for you.
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Is everything all right, dear?
So that's two of my wives.
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
You had fantasies about Emily?
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
You guys know where Rachel is?
Hey.
I don't know, I-I was all high.
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Yes you did! What was it?
His daughter was hot.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
No, I, I only know Lipson.
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
It's what you want. You should go.
What?
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Me too.
I know, and I can't stop sweating.
Your hands are shaking.
Is this what you had in mind?
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Well, it needs to be plicit.
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Right.
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Oh! And it gets worse!
Was that place... The Sun?
You're wearing the same shirt.
I can see why, nice shirt!
Really girls, not cool.
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Me too. I'm good at it.
Totally. I had sex in High school...
Look, I took it too far!
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Look at all these paleontologists!!
Wow! This place is beautiful!
She doesn't know what to say!
I don't know what to say.
OK, I need to lie down.
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Then what am I supposed to do?
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
All right, we'll work it out.
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
We don't have to.
Look, they must be stopped!
No!! You can't!!
No, just give me another minute.
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
Do you know the word crapweasel?
Poco... a leetle.
Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Wha-, oh, quit it.
It's my TV.
....I have to go to China.
Hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
Hey, someone order a coat?
Well what is it? Let me see.
Are you wearing two belts?
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
So I nodded off a little.
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
What are you doing here, Santa?
Hey!
How can you not believe in evolution?
Check this out. Can I have this?
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
Hey!
Oh, you have some studying to do?
Uhh, I can't.
So, so now do I get Joey?
Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
Why is it inside out?!
Yes it is!
Ah, which, which one?
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
Yeah, where were you!
No, but, your-your mad.
It's fine.
Try telling my wife that.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Everything? Even the TV?
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Okay, guys, wish me luck.
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
I wanna say it's not looking good.
Uh... November?
No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
Rob Tillman!
Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle.
Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk... somebody here?
I guess it's worth a try.
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Where the hell have you been?
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
We are a rare breed.
well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
I think we proved our point.
Ah, there we go.
Please tell me you're joking.
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Just, just say what you feel.
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Wh- are you welling up?
Mm-hmm.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
You too! What are the odds?
Congratulations!
Slides are almost ready.
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Okay, can we just sign please?
Nothing.
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
So, are you gonna see him again?
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
It's okay man, be strong.
I wanna quit the gym.
I'll get it! I will get that!
Pizza delivery!
Where exactly is your zoo?
...Flame Boy.
And why exactly would I do that?
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
Did the TV wake you?
Ok.
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Yeah, maybe...
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Great. I feel like an idiot.
Oh!
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
73! 72! 71!
Oh no, wait! Joey!
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
No.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
Go.
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I know. I am, I am so sorry.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Hey! What's she doing back here?
How did you...know?
Over my dead body!
Yeah, that makes sense.
What, uh... what were you thinking?
Sex in his chair.
Nothing! What do you say to that?
Oh my God! What did you say?
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Why-why would I care about that?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
No. It's the one he's licking.
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
Ooh, you almost had it.
And that's, that's funny why?
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Are those your teeth??
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
I-I had to show Chandler something?
Why is Ross naked?
That! Let's talk about that.
You are so adorable.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Catch any big fish?
Hey!
I have to break up with Charlie?
Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
Why? Why can't you go to him?
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Ok, Michelle, it's time to go.
No, actually, see I had to pee, 'cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
One more day, seriously/
Ohh, Ross, please!
There isn't that's what I'm saying.
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy well what about ok well there's gotta be someone.
...How long was I in there?
The lights, please..
Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
THE HELL I DO!
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
Are you kidding? Oh my God...
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Bye.
They're not listening too me?
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
I have a bone to pick with you.
Coming.
How do you count to five?
How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
This could've been hers!
Eh? We'll show him!
I like it!
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
It'll be great for next weekend.
Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
You were amazing out there.
You said you'd marry Joey?
Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets back? Thank you.
What difference does that make?!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Ohh, yeah I already have one.
Exactly.
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
What about the guy from the bar?
Oh yeah.
That is one good looking man!
Hi!
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Why-why aren't you more excited?
And now you want that money back.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
I sort've already asked Chandler.
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
And the place looks so nice!
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
It was a car backfire!
She already lives in London.
You play hard to get.
Not using it right, Joe.
I know I should've. "I'm sorry."
All right, I just wanted to check.
Yeah.
Why, why would you open it?
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
You're look for laughable...
Nope, just the one. RACH!
So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
You got me a cola drink?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Hi you guys!
Who's drink can I freshen?
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
If only he were a woman.
God, he's good.
I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Oooh, I like that, "daddy"
I've lost the will to live.
Oh my God!!
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
Ross!
What? Are you going back to work?
Oh.
Okay, you are totally making this up.
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
What was that?
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
So I'm gonna take off then!
Yeah, okay, bye.
We'll be starting with apples.
All right, we'll start with...apples.
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Are you ok, Ross?
Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
You are, you're welling up.
No.
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...
Okay.
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Makes me wanna puke!
It's still looks pretty far!
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Okay, it must just be me then.
No.
Could you be less enthused?
So...Thank you.
Why do they keep doing that?
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Huh, I took a shot there.
She is good!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Yeah.
You sprayed my front twice!
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
Well? Isn't that amazing?
I know.
Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
No.
I got bottled breast milk.
I got beer.
Well...In-in case of emergency.
Why? Why do I have to learn?
What?! Give-give me a brush.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
Professor Geller?
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
We'll see how dinner goes.
Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
Wow, how many have you got?
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
This is not good for my rage.
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Hey, save us some pizza.
I guess.
Ok, here, here. There we go.
This is how I would hold a football.
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Well did you try calling her?
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
So this is an annual thing?
She won a thousand dollars!
I'm dead and no one cares?
Ok!
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
-Peaches?
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
...But a man can change.
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Oh, major shampoo explosion!
What? What is it?
What?! Over a stupid room!
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
Really? You're not gonna return it?
Oohh, I love it!
Well... not in the same way...
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Ok, got the vent open.
Oh, god.
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Thank you so much for that gift!
Wow! That was amazing!
Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
What, that wasn't the great news?
And now for the great news.
Then be supportive like a guy.
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Look, you wanna get off my back?
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
Nooo, but it, but it's great.
You wanna touch it?
What you got over there? Tacos?
No! Shhh!
Hey, where's uh, where's mom?
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
How we doing, you guys ready?
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
She seems really, really fun!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
It uhh, it won't go back.
Well put it back.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Well, actually...
No, but it is frowned upon.
Oh, is that against the rules?
So what's it shaped like?
That is wild.
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Please. This is so your fault.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
If you wanna call that a reason.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Still doing the screening thing?
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Uh, hello, it's third down.
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
You didn't just break up.
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Who jumps at loud noises!
It was, it was her voice.
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Baking it didn't help, huh?
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
A pajmena?
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Just, just, just pick one!
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
What is with you tonight?
No thank you for... Thank you.
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Correct, his profession was?
Maurice.
And what are you going to do for him?
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
No, that that is not what we're saying.
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
No... I already e-mailed her.
Bet she'd sleep with you now...
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Ohhhh.
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
Alright you kids, bye now.
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
Did I, did I even treat?
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Come on! Come on. Come on.
Okay, scarf's done.
And you didn't marry him because...?
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Please don't say naked chicks.
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
I said it first, bro.
And she's supposed to buy this?!
I'm comin' out!
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it.
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Happy New Year.
No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
Ohh, that's too bad!
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
No no no, behind it.
That's all you're basing this on?
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
No, no, don't. Why don't we?
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
I made fun of his accent.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
And why do you care so much?
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Dude. You're married to my sister.
Sure, nice.
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
It's my new apothecary table!
Oh no!
And it works both ways.
Nooo!
I don't know, probably just invest it.
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
When did I say you were boring?!
You said I was boring--Ohh!
Yeah, no one talks like that!
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
All right.
Except for "Match game"...
Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
All right, did you just say all right?
All right.
No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
There's something new in the bowl.
What?
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Sure, we don't live there but...
Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Hey! Hi!
Are you not seeing him anymore?
Oh.
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
We've come for her things.
It's alright, it's no big deal.
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
What? How come that you don't have to go!
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
You're getting a cat?
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
And um...You look nice today.
Yeah!
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Why are we in bed together?
Ohhh!
No, women are welcome to play.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
The physical act of love.
And um, what-what is that Ross?
You have a line down your face.
Oh I...I think they're funny.
I dunno, there's just something about...
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
That money is mine, Green!
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
I went to Egypt with my dad.
What did you do on yours?
That's worse than no food.
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
I wrote you a letter.
Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
What? That's like insanely easy!
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
Really? Did you count Mississipily?
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Hi honey, how did it go?
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Do not give him any money!
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Monica and Chandler are living together!
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Well, he had gravity boots.
He broke that.
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
No.
And that's not against your oath?!
On the touchy.
Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
We love you. Buy.
Oh, it was, nah, well....
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
All right. I think it was a mouse.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Mississippilesly? Well, how bad is it?
Mississippi? I said count to five'!
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Okay. So we're, we're good?
Apology accepted.
Ohh, this cake is really good!
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
...teen!
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Is it? Feels like two.
Ross, ten o'clock.
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
I want to take my tongue... and...
I, er...
How much did you pay for that?
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Let me see that! Oh man!
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Hey, you guys... I have great news.
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
And she feels the same way?
I'm crazy about her.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
Can you please, please take care of it for me?
You really serve people sneezers?
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Those two only had each other!
You told her before you told us?
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
Hey.
The chocolates aren't here yet.
Hey guys!
Yeah, were better off without them.
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
They make you take an oath?
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
My first time with Carol was...
Then what?
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Huh? So? We have a deal?
Wow, that's pretty cool.
Oh good, you haven't left yet.
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
I am not doing this over the phone.
She's got her cell, you could call her.
Was your basket on top?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
...and I really think it should be me.
Oh, you're right.
I'm sorry... we... we can't.
I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
You did.
What, uh... what juggling thing?
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Events from around the globe.
Yeah, what's it about?
And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
Wh-what's that?
No, she was definitely on my bed.
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
It's also a sign of friendship.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
Can't we just use a pen?
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
All right, sorry.
Won't you dance around with me.
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
Because you sent away the dog!
Why not?
Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.
Yes, and she's very supportive.
And I too am just a love machine.
What?
That only took me an hour.
You must stop!
We uh, we just cooked it up.
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
You gotta be at least bi...
Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Not for the next few minutes.
But you're still my friend?
Well, then who was on my bed?
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Rach, have you never done this before?
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
Hey.
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
Well, somebody should.
What's wrong with being the Bings?
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
So-so what did the doctor say?
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
On account of my rage.
Why?!
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
And on your anniversary, for shame!
I was not flirting.
...that center around work.
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Well you need 60% to pass...
Why?!
Surely you can think of something good.
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Even if we want it really bad.
No matter how much we want it.
You were my first kiss with Rachel?
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Just one cheek.
Why- why are you here, Carol?
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
With such a sad history.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
You want me to call her right now?
Ross thanks.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
I could ask her to live with me!
What?
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
Hello?
We?! We angered it?!
We appear to have angered it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
She wants me to move to London.
What?!
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
people so why you all dressed up.
Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?
Just ah... just put roommate.
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
I know, yeah.
I hope Ben has a little sister.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Nice, put it with the others.
USA Today.
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
Hey.
All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
I see. You didn't happen to tell.
... that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
So umm, where are the other guys?
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
I don't know what... you're talking about.
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Rachel said she'd marry you?!
Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Hi, pig!
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Ross, thank God.
No. I am not putting on makeup.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
That little naked guy would be me.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
I'm kidding!
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
...is for me not to see you anymore.
Yeah?
You never cooked since 1996.
Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Alright boys, let's eat.
I'm not a nice guy.
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
What?
Is that supposed to be an insult?
I said art lover.
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
I got glasses!
Answer better, answer better!
I don't know!
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Well, why're you all dressed up?
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
But-but, Liam's on my team.
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
Nothing I do means anything, really.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Hey! Ready to go?
Okay, well the ??? is not home.
And lots of kissing your neck.
She said you gave her the razor!
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Oh my God.
Hey listen man, about the stripper...
I don't have anything.
We're still going at the game, right?
That's some gentle comedy, dude.
15? Your personal best!
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Was I talking to her about gas?
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
Hi, did you order some bananas?
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
You're kid's name is Raymond!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
I can't believe no one believes me!
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
You got ink on your lip.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
No, come on don't start. Ouch!
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
Isn't that amazing?
Are you're hands still wet?
...love you.
So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Oh, good.
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Alright, now you say something.
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Rach, she's got like three hairs!
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
So really, what'd ya have?
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
What's wrong with people having sex?
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
After you.
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Really?
Who cares? I repel women.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
I'm good, I have dinner plans .
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
So uh, have a great time down there.
Thank you!
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Get away from me I said no!
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
It-it's great to meet you Paul.

Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
You complete me kitchen, matey!
What?!
First of all, I'm not losing...
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Fine, then why didn't you say something?
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
That is so good! Do it again!
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
Hey does anyone have any gum?
I'm pretty.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Real magic does exist.
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?

No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Oh my god.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Are you into crafts at all?
What?
Dad, she won't want to go with me.

Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
That sounds great. Same for me.
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
No one, I'm just saying if...
Why? Who'd you seen him with?
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
Still sharp as a tack!
You're not Rachel.
That was 14 hours ago.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
So, thank you for the delicious dinner.

It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
I played bad on purpose guys.
What?
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Hey!
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning.
I don't know.
He gave me a pill for it.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
What's up with the greed Joe?
I see where you're goin'!
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Melt stuff.
What? Great, now I'm having a baby.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!

Do they wait for me to do this?
Ciao, bela.
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

Hey.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Stupid balls are in the way.
What?
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
So, so, did you hear?
Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
You had a rough day, uh?
Yeah.
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Marcel! What've you done to him?
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
AND ON MY TURF?
Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Not on you! On the stripper!
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Then where the hell have you been?!
That's right! I'm not!
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Just uh, brought back your videos.
Hi.

Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
You know the song! Sing along!
One, two, three, four!
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
What the hell happened on that beach?!
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
Uh, Rach?
Mon, look who I ran into!
Hey!
Oh please, hit by a blimp?
Well, how you died was funny.
Because there are naked ladies there.
How does going to a strip club help him better?
uhu uhu, check this out.
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Hi.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Let's also get a hot plate!
Shut the book!
No? What happened, big guy?
Nope.
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
No, I mean it's not Geller.
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Hey!
Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!
Wow!!
He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
She's right y'know.
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Come on!
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
Number six: the way you smell.
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
One, two, three, four!
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Hey.
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
You just give him a spoon baby!
Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense anymore.
Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
Tuesday.
So we should probably get going soon.
You okay? You all right?
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
No!
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
How come you didn't come over earlier?
The head, the head. You gotta...
Ross, can I?
Why does anyone have to be naked?
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Hey.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Thanks.
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
Did you see me write one down?
Did she leave a number?
No, she kept kicking me away!
Not the other one?
All right, gentlemen, you're up first.
Okay.
What! You didn't do anything wrong?!
Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong.
To wear in front of people?
It's a bathing suit?
Hey, what you do on your own time...
The sheep.
Walls are pretty thin, guys!
Damn it!
So, how dark is it gonna get?
Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.

Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
Yes, she jumped right back up.
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
So-so come! Why don't you come?
Oh, I know.
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
What? You're leaving?!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
The guy you gave your number to.
What? Who?
I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
And the destination?
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Then you are neither of your parents!
No.
These-these are beads of joy.
Well, you're-you're sweating.
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Ross.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
Oh, me too.
Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
This is the coolest house ever!!
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
...But a man can change.
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Was that the cake?
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
Thank you.
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
I see. So what do you propose to do?
Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
What's ah, what's so funny about that?
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
Then we agree?
What? You have a date? Who with?
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Oh... I'm back!
Hey, I've been married 3 times

Get your hands out of there! No!
Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three.
It's the off light. Right Ross?
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
We fell asleep! That is all.
Well, I don't know!!
There's something you didn't know about your dad!
I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
Hi honey.

Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!

Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.

Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!

Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
Okay, we owe you a present.
Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!
I can't believe you're not going to propose!
So, um, what do you do for a living?
If you don't do it, I will.
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Um-hmm.
You keep, you keep... You can't...
What?
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
And he's, he's a total stranger?
Uh-huh!
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
What, you, you really quit your job?
What?
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
That's so sweet.
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
You can totally, totally live on this.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
No.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Hi.
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
We don't make enough fun of you already?
I cannot sleep in a public place.
How does she do that?
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Ross, where did you get this?!
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
Why would I eat my own arm?
I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
You hated me when we were kids?
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
I'll take it. My gift to you man.
Yeah.
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
No, you cannot.
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
What?
Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
She's putting words in your mouth!
No, no! We made this decision together.
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
What's wrong buddy?
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
A lot of other gas smells...
Well okay!
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
Three of your five, what?
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
If you wanna put a label on it.
You mean they're lovers.
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Well... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
That's because he's on your neck.
Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
Monica told me you had a blind date.
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
I need juice! People need juice!!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
When they see this you'll be 52!
What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
Thanks. What photo album was it?
Yeah.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Whoa! You were down on one knee?
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
What, oh my God. What did you do?
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Hi!
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Well actually...
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Uh-oh.
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Let it go, Ross.
When, when were you... under me?
Ohh, ohh.
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
No!!
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
You were under the pile of coats?
YES!
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
Okay.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
How come? Everybody else does.
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Thank you.
Well that's the first time we've said that.
Well I love you too.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
No.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
Whip it out, whip it out.
You bitch.
Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
You put an offer on a house?
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE.
They kept your room for a while.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
Huh? Ooh you mean like a... Huh?
Nope! I still can't believe she slept with you in the first place.
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Hey! Where have you been?
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Okay, good.
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
Oh God, absolutely.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
So.
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Listen, I um... I heard about the engagement.
Hey.
OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
Really? You think so?
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Damn it. It's never off the table.
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
...Now that was fun.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want?
Thank you! Thank you!
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Hey!
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Y'know, he hums when he pees!
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Emily.
Some days it's all I can think about.
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
It's my joke.
Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Good day for married people huh?
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Why'd you freak out?
That's okay. We'll talk about something else.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it.
W-What was the one right before bananas?
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
All right, that's it, I'm getting out of here.
What? They will be!
Were you the ones called the cops?!
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Sure, I know lots of girls.
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
Take thee, Emily...
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Hey.
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .
Yeah!
um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
Hey!
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Yes, you're having a boy!
Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
uhm... Is everything okay?
Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
What?
So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
So spooky, that's all.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Yes you did, gleba is a word!
I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words .
Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
I meant with my son.
So you took off my pants and shoes?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
You could drink the fat.
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Monica's wasted.
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Who's Paul?
Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
What do you mean, comforted her?
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
No one got me an engagement present.
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Do you want any help?
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
What's up?
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
Well, it is overdue.
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Space cowboy!
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Isn't he good?
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Does so count!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Yes.
now I feel terrible this is all my fault.
would you call this girl? thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing.
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Chandler!
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Oh my God.
What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
These are for Erica!
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
He's got a girlfriend!
Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
You kissed.
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
Uhh, 11!
You know how close women can get.
Like lovers.
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
What?
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
That is an old, Chinese woman!
Oh my God! Is that him?
You let Rachel come back, and it's done.
You can really arrange that?
Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!
You okay?!
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume, I'm fluent in.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Oh, I got that for him.
But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
Why, why, why would you dream that?
Exellent dream score.
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
Yeah!
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
You can have the last piece, if you want.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Yeah right!
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
OK.
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Well don't just say.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Well, maybe you don't need them.
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
Oh my god, crap from the street?
I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
This is totally your fault!
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
What is it?
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Dr. Oberman.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
Home is Home Star stew.
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Then I won't have to kill you.
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
Got it!
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
It won't come off!
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
I don't have a page.
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
Thank you.
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
Thank you.
Well you sure used a large font.
Me! On my computer.
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Huh! Where is the dog?!
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Oooh.
Too little, too late, Benji!
Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
They don't look any bigger than me!
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
Until we start to look very small.
Wait, how long?
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Here's my retainer!
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Wait, are you leaving?
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Absolutely.
Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
Bye.
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!
Okay.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Ugh.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Okay, here comes another camera.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
The big book of childrens' names.
What was the book?
C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
So let's decide on the spending limit...
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
And what did he ask you not to call him?
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Thanks.
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
Where you goin'?
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
I am shocked! Shocked!!
I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
Ditto.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Later!
You even have to ask?! He is alive!
Would you like a lollypop?
Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
But also knowing it means a lot.
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
How are you ever going to sell this place?
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Hi!
I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
Sure who are you?
What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Hey!
Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
EH, what do you know!
No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
You've never turned?
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Exactly.
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
She took all my stuff.
Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?
Fears and Pet Peeves.
Ranion's theory of species variegation?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me.
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
So you eh, you talked to Joey?
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Do you want me to pick you?!
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
Ross...
Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Tails!
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
Right.
Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
Enter Amy!
All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
Okay, here we go.
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
What-what's going on?!
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
Okay, let's talk outside.
She lent me an egg once.
Any contact?
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Shhhh!!!
No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
You didn't!
Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
And here's little Ben nodding off...
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
You know what I like most about him, though?
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
The way he makes me feel about myself.
What?
That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
What?!
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
Dance karate?
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
Yeah.
Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
Yep! You got the tickets?
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
Really.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
No.
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Charity?
All right! You go get him! Let's go!
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Mark's a genius!
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
"When can you move in?"
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Uh-huh.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I Left, I Said I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in...
Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Hi!
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
I'm Irish.
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
What the hell was that?!
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
No!
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Mmmm!
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Earl Grey?
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
That commercial always makes me so sad.
Oh, yeah!
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
Ohhhhh!
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Do you have any respect for your body?
Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
It's perfect.
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Oh. Thanks.
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
What?
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Are you serious?
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Like what?
Well, these. These are yours right here.
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
I'll just run to the store and get some.
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Somebody lose a ring?
Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
What?
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
It was the ring!
It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
This is gonna make me very popular.
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
Yeah? What did ya have?
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
What?
Kinda like a big face without skin.
What's it look like?
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Hey!
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
No.
That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Bye!
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
At least tell me where you hid it.
No!
Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Oh my God, this is so cool!
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
That must be our alcohol and beers!
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
Robert's coming out.
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
Caitlin!
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
Me too.
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Ross.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
I don't have ten minutes!!
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Oh.
Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Hi!
We have to stop them before something happens!
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Sixty guests.
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
What's going on?! That's what's going on!!
What is going on?
We have got to start locking that door!
Oh!
Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
So, so is she still going to Paris?
Well y'know 'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
Yeah?
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
What happens if you flick it?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
You've never said that in your life, have you?
It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
It does. It really and truly does.
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Why can't I find that?
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
After what I did? Can you blame her?
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Ohhh...
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
And?
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
Uh-huh!
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Great!! That's great!
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Hey.
Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Oww!
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
Yeah, I do.
Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
Hey.
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
When, when did-how, how did you...
Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Ugh, okay Sherlock!
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
The sex of the baby, Ross.
Better not be doin' these in order.
Well, there's you.
Come on. All right, here we go. All right?
Okay.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
You're welcome.
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Oh my.
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
All right!
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
What kinda noise?
Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?
I don't know.
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
Say we are unagi!
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Everybody!!
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...
Ross! Wait!
So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Yes.
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Hm-mmm!
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
The museum was amazing!
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Ok, how about this ?
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?
Hey, how was class?
Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Wha... the next one?
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
What do you like better flora or fauna?
Uh-hmm.
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
I can't tell you that, no.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
Yeah.
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
I don't what your talking about.
B, B, B, B, B!
Fine, it's fine... I'll just shower by myself...
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Oh, hi sweetie.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Who needs a lease when it's family!
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
No, no, no.
yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
Oh.
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
What are you doing?
There was no song. There was no song!
Oh please God, let there be a song.
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Thanks for dinner last night.
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
What?!
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Where is Emily?
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
What are you guys talking about?
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
What is up?
Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
I do love you.
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
We were out of Doritos.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
Dr. Wiener.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
What?! Are you kidding?!
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
What?
We think Chandler might be having an affair.
All right...
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
Sure.
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Just get away from me!
Y'know what? I don't like you without mom. Come on.
Come on!
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Rach we have a code brown situation.
Excuse me?
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
I'm in love with you.
I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
Dude, you're shaking!
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Ugh. Ross!
No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Oh, that's pretty.
Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
Professor Geller?
Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
NO, no science camp!
A lot of people are thankful for those.
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Ross, are you okay?
That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
You may want to lose the foam finger!
Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
That could be it.
Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
Don't tear it.
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you...you gave her the ring?
Well then why did you give me a ring?
Of course she would, you're a college man.
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. Do you guys do random drug testing?
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Yeah Im fine.
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Ross, what's the matter?
wow, are you still going to move in with him?
Never.
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Because, he's my friend.
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
I don't think so.
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
I don't know.
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
No, it's okay, you didn't know.
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
Do you wanna play football?
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
I respectfully disagree.
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Then you should have said something before I met her.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
All right!!
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
I think so.
People are doing it in front of my book!
Secret affair!
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
There y'go. Ross?
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
Yesss?
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Who isn't?
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
Oh yeah? Fine.
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Where's Monica?
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Hey!
Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Hi!
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
Monica, I'm your best friend.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Whoa-ho.
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Dangerous Liaisons.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
And the bunny got away.
Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Yeah!
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
I'm going for a walk.
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
So, I got the results of the amnio today.
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
Vicrum?
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Hey!
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
And so young.
Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
So, why are you still wearing it?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Ow! Ow!
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
You can tell us.
What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Oh-oh!
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
I'm not on the list!
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Eww!!
They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
What?
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
What's going on?
Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Hey!
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Well, I took it.
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
Oh yeah, go ahead.
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Well, did-did you correct him?
So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Hey!
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
Oh, thank you!
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Too far, Amy. Too far.
You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.
So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
Ross, she's 25 years old.
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Lucky bastard!
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
Ohhhh.
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Yeah. That's me!
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
What is this? What are we doing?
If you want to check your email, just ask!
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
Ohh, get these things out of me!
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
Well, then...Let's.
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
W-wait. What is that?
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
No you don't.
Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Do you mind telling us what it is?
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
"Big guy?"
Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Macadamia nut?
Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Yeah.
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
No-no.
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
It took two people to break up this relationship!!
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
I'm not a dropper!
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Hey! Ross!
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Thanks.
Lighter than air... But that's not the point.
Oh... How are they?
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Ok.
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
You told on us?
Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
Good.
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Look at that!
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Hey guys!
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
Are you wearing my glasses?
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
Oh, hello liar.
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
I'll get our seats.
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
I do know.
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
I did!
I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
So that's your second marriage in two years.
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
She's right! You have to stop!
Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
Have fun!
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
Is your tongue swelling up?
That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
All right, you!
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
No.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
Ouh...
I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Oh.
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
You're okay there?
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
We could write it down for you?
Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Not a one.
Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
What happened son?
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Ooh.
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Um, would you like to come in?
Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
All right, I trust you.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Oh, "you do, do you"?
You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Well, I, I should go in there.
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
That's really a day shoe.
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Well, I can't help you.
Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Oh!
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
I got it! Scotch... tape.
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
That's not so good.
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Well, there you go!
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
Did I go to this school?
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Shh! Of course, why don't we go inside?
Making out in your office.
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Really?
Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
I'll be right back.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
Really?
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
The players.
But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.
Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone doanything else.
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
I'm just cleaning up.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Christmas.
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.
Hi! Bye!
Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Kills you?
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Getting it away from me would be job one.
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
No, but let's come back to that later!
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Are you okay? What's wrong?
Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.
M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Hi.
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
We love you, man.
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
I'm in the shower!
That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... .
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
No, no, no!
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Big fat goalie.
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.
Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
Sure!
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
Could you guys help me?
Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Come on, touch it!
I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
I don't care! You just get him!
Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
God bless you Chandler Bing!
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Just get out! Now!!
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Hold on! There is something different.
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Fauna.
Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Okay.
Female body inspector? What size is that?
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
I know!
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Why?
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
Yes! .... or no.
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
What did you just do?
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
And Monica knows...
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
Hey!
Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Dude!
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
No! Wait! Come on!
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
And you know what? We want a rematch.
Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh...
Oh, I didn't, I didn't know that.
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Okay, hating this.
Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
Got stood up, huh?
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
What?!
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
I paid for those tickets!
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
What's your problem?
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
That's a two line part.
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Yeah, I got too excited!
Well, technically it seven billion years ago...
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
Oh.
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Hey!
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Stop going through my stuff ! Rachel: Hey!
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Over here dad.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
He carries a briefcase.
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
But you already told me everything.
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Uh-huh.
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
Hey.
And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
That's a great story-can I eat it?
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
That won't be necessary.
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
There you go.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Maureen Rosilla.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Uh-huh.
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
I can come back.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
How, how, um how can you not be going?
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
Sure.
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
My parents are going to be really mad.
Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Yes.
OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Great. That would be fine.
YAY! quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Yeah.
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Fourth gear!!
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
That's Carol with your son!
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Yeah, coffeehouse.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Set....hike!
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
You just carry that around?
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
I don't know! I don't remember!
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Shhhh!
Well, that's what I'm here for. Want me to get that?
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.
Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
So, do you get colours or just French tips?
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much.
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
What are you talking about?
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Oh, great! Me too.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Right...
Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Hello?
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
What do you mean?
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
If anything should happen to him...
Yes, I did, I did! I should have written it down!
Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
What?
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Yeah. No. No...
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
How are ya man?
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
But, we are.
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Ohh, with who?
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
She didn't hang up either...
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
She didn't hang up either!
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! Did you write this?
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
He's sleeping.
Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
What is that?
Oh, holy molly are we in a pickle now.
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!
Why not?
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Too?
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Hey man, what's up?
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
What's that?
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Let me get my coat.
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
Yep.
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Hey!
So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! I'm not helping.
Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Joey: What have you got there?
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... These are amazing!
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
What?!
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Hi.
Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Oh, damn you Geller!
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Come on, would you grow up? It's no big deal.
Rosss...
Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
A scooter!
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Thanks.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Dude that is so sad.
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Yeah.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
You what?
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Molly ... people don't study acting ...
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
What?
Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
I don't have travel insurance.
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
Bye.
Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Let's do this alright.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
Jacket now.
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Great!
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
Do you love her?
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Shut up, Joey!
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
What about that circled one?
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Hey man, what's up?
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Water! Water! Water!
Ok ... Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha . I'll see you tomorrow.
Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here.
Good luck to ya!
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Okay.
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Yeah, I remember.
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
But, I put some honey in it.
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
You don't say.
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
It is starting to get dark out there.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
Exactly.
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
When you thought Joey proposed did...did you say yes?
I'm sorry, what?
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Good idea! Yes!
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Bwah-hah-hah!
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
OK.
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
No.
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
Good luck.
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
You or me?
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
I bet you did!
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Yeah, I'm her date.
I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
Huh?
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
I don't know, I'm very tired.
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
So what.
You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Yeah, I know.
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Then it's okay!
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
I am supposed to be the mommy?
I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
Your license please.
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Yeah.
I guess if everybody else is... Closing credits.
Me too.
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.
Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .
Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
Oh God! I gotta go!
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Ohh, it's a bit small.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
He has a gun!
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Alright, I got it Ross.
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
You're gonna kill me!
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Yeah.
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
What?
Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Oh, Rachel!
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
So, what do you think?
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
Like?
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
So what's going on with you?
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
That was you?
Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that.
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!
I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
I really can't say.
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Hey!
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
I wasn't escaping.
Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
I am... free!
Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
We have to get out of here, baby!
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
What's with you?
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
No!
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Hey!
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Hi! What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
Nothing.
Dad seriously! Y'know you really should see someone about that!
Deal!
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
I know!
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
A meatball Sub? Thanks!
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
It's us.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
What's goin' on?
Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Actually they were Nana's.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
So what's it gonna be?
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Yeah, okay.
"...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
"I'm a little bit country"...
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
I'll do it!
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Die Hard!!!!!!
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
I don't know. What are you wearing?
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Oh, I'd like that.
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Yeah!
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Hi, honey.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Huh.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
God! Ross!
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Bye!
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
I got it.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
So, let's go.
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
That's right.
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
No.
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
What?! What? What happened?!
Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Ok.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Chandler gets pedicures!
Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan...
Well, thanks for the books.
Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Goodnight.
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
I will.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
Ross, what're you doing.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
So, how many have you sold so far?
This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
Ok...
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Are you guys gonna be okay?
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Woah, dude, burn.
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Well, maybe I can help.
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Who wrote it?
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
I believe you know my husband.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
What do we do? What do we do?
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
... Ok, who is this?
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
What?!
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
That's what they'll call us.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Hello.
You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
What's up?
Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
I wish I could.
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
Oh my god you're right.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".
OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
You, you are gonna love this.
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
And look where they're sitting.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
I felt it!
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Hey.
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
Yes, I do.
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Ross!
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Hi honey!
Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Okay! When?!
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
I think it could be kind of great!
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
I won the game.
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted.
All right, me too. Should we wake her up?
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
I think I need a drink.
Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
What does he look like?
Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.
Yeah-No!!
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Yeah?
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Rachel.
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
Ok. B - O - S ...
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
It's horrible.
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
All right, you two, stop it!
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
You're weird today. Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy.
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
Stop it!
No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
Did she go out with him?
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
You are going downer!
OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. You're welcome.
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Chicken Kiev?
Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
Don't you just love it?
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
I'm hurt.
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Oh yeah!
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
Mm-hmmm
Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda...
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
What?
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
A lesbian?
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
I know!
Ah? Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
My cousin's a paleontologist.
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
Ahh.
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
You don't.
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
What? Wait, what?
You-you're gonna get married?! I mean... We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
Yep, pretty much.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
So, are you a member of any gym.
Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
Ohh, uh-huh so much!
I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
Maybe...
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Sometimes we were.
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Yes, Bunny?
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Oh yeah! With who?
You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
And I won!
Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you.
But you two were supposed to be together.
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
Alright, let's take this outside.
Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Wow, what?
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
What's too much fun?
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
Huh.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
God she is unbelievable.
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
Monica Gellerrr.
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
Right-right up here.
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
Hi.
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Oh.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
I know, I hate being left out of things.
They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
That was a good day!
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Good luck.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Yeah. That's Daddy.
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Ooh... Dr. Geller!
Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
Are you over me?
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
No!!
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
Yes.
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
I'll give you $1 for them.
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
So what are you gonna do?
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
I was not!
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Here's your scone.
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
How do you figure that?
Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Oh, yay!
I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here. No, uh-uh, just go.
You need to learn some new slang.
It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Oh! How's it going?
Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Sure, sure. What's with the chair.
Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: "Mommy, I'm a girl, take me with you."
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Oh... Yeah, you do.
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
I know.
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
What?
Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Yes! Did you see that?
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Fine! We went out.
Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
Sorry.
Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" "Oh, thank you very much!" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
We want the last six years back!!
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Sorry.
I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
Hey!
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
Monica's pregnant.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
I was not flirting.
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
Oh.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
I am not telling you guys anything.
Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!
Hey, hey!
Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Weekend at Bernie's.
No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
SURPRISE!!!
You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
Yeah.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Hmm.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
I could not have done this without you.
You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
Your thumb? That's weird. You sure you're punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
He offered me one.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
How's it going?
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
All right.
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
Hang on a second I just got in.
Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Yeah.
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
No, only for sex.
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!

No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
Oh.
You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Oh, that's better then.
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, but Joey's my-No! Ah!
Well-Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
Oh no, what happened?
Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
Hey.
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
You have to really wanna see it.
Believe me, if I did see with someone, there's no way I...
All right. . He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat.
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Isn't that cute?
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Hi everyone.
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Hey!
What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
For camp!
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Well, what did the police say?
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Carol...Lesbian?
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
Where have you been?
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Happy birthday.
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um...I didn't propose to you.
Surprised?
Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
Right, and the humiliating.
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Ross!
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
No.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
You know he's gay?
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
It-it's really heavy.
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
Hi!
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
Chandler told me.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Yeah.
Okay. So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Ooh, very official.
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Hm-mmm.
Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The Metsss!
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
I love you too!
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Uhhhooo.
I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
OOH! God! Sorry!
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
I'll be okay.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Ohh, yeah.
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Then free as a bird. What's up?
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
Hey! How was it?
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
It's my baby too.
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Aw, thanks!
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
Help!
Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart.
A guy who won two.
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so...
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
All right I'll have one.
Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Blow it.
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Hmm, yeah. Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
Rossy, we're ready for you.
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Really? You can actually see it?
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.
No, wait, you don't have my phone number!
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
So, tell me about it.
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
You do?
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! .
You said...
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
I had a great time. It was really top drawer. And Here's Something Rich thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
We're getting married!
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
I don't know.
Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace.
"Delta Dawn"
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
You think?!
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Oh my God.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Come on Ben.
Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
Stupid balls are in the way.
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
Bye.
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Eight whole days.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Thanks man.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
No, not if their room has two beds!
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Thanks man.
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Deal! TIME LAPSE.
Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Bye!
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
I'm sorry, I do that.
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Uh-huh... right... yeah...
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Oh, me too.
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Thanks daddy.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Yeah!
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Okay.
I am a doctor! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
Pick me!!
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Well, whatever works for ya...
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Sure, he was in your "band"?
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
What?
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
What are you doing here?
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Ross, you don't have to yell.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words .
I don't know all the words.
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Oh wow.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Really?
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
Ohh. What is this?
Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
That was kind of rude!
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
Hat, milk, got it.
Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Really? Excited?
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
Pulling what? It's second down.
Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!
I try...
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
And I will see you tomorrow!
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
What's going on?
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
1200.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
I really do.
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
There. Now there is.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Thanks.
Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Oh.
I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
You bet.
Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
Thanks for coming you guys.
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
No!
Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?
AWCH! That's why.
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Why don't you open with a joke?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.
Hey cool, mine too.
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny...
Ross, don't. Ross!
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Hey!
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
Oh no.
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Or?
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Really?!
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
What?! Why?
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
You put your fist through the wall?
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
Thank you, Ross.
I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
What thing? What thing?
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Yeah! C'mon!
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Why not?
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
All right, well how much time do you need?
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
5 6 7 8!
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
Because we hate them.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Aww, look at the little thing.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
That sounds fair.
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Hey, hubby!
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Do you not want to be seen with me?
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
Because that would be crazy?
You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
What d'you want?
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well....
You must be so happy!
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
No.
Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Oh... Italy, I think.
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
That's right.
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you... you mugged me?
"Gimme your money, punk!"
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
Could I be more sorry.
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
What? We could do it!
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
Uh-huh.
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
How, how is this my fault?
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
And, a lemon lime.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
I am Guru Saj.
Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Licorice?
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
....yeah... what else?
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Here, let me try.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Now, don't argue with me...
Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
Phonetically?
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
I know!
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
What's up, Ross?
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Oh crap!
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
Awesome, the name really stands out.
Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
Oh... uh... look... before you...
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Same category?
Actually I'm a palian... Dinosaurs is fine... the drawing is not.
Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Okay...
Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
What are the odds? What are the odds?
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Hey!
And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
I saw you.
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Uh, good.
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Wow! Thanks!
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Okay.
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Watching ballroom dancing?
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Yeah.
Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
So are you gonna...talk to her?
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Monica.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Hey!
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
What?! You say that to kids?!!
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Ok, who ordered what?
Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
You, you want me to help you with that?
Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
You don't know?
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
What?
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
So?
Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
What... What...
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
I call Godfather!
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
Oh, so everything's okay?
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
Yeah, Ross is here so...
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Uh... What can I do for you?
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Hey.
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
Yeah!
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
Great!
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
So you didn't leave the bank?
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
I guess.
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Really?
To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
Ross, where are you going?
Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Wow, this place looks great.
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Sure.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
Me too.
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
It's not a real game! I made it up!
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
I will flip you for it.
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
I'm sorry, let her?
What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
What's a matter with you?
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Nope, nope, that's it.
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Which do I like?
What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Noo.
I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
They are awfully boxy...
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Sorry, prom queen.
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
Yeah, I...
Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
Oh thank God!
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
Really?
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
I'll try.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Talk to me.
You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
We were gonna go see the Jets!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Let me try it on!
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?
oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
What?
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
You don't think we should wait for him?
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
Yeah!
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
All right.
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Noo.
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
Maybe.
Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
We're gonna have sex.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Yeah.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
No, Joey!
I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Ok. If you really need to.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! Huh?
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
Maye it's me.
Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Just some stuff for the party.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
Ahh!
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
You pushed him!
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
What were you doing?
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Um, hum.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
What?
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. Joey: It's a science.
Hey! So what show are you on?
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Will the stable boy never get the princess??
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
We're uh, we're getting married.
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Grazie.
Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
Um... Ross?
What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
No.
I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Ross, what is taking you so long?
She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
I know the code to his answering machine.
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Surprise!!!
Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Ross!
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
Sandwiches!
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
What?!
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
Huh?
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
Get my glasses too.
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
You want some?!
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
You'll have a last kiss.
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
Oh, they're real!
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Ooh... Not so good.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
You wanna know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people.
I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Potassium.
Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
Ooh! Tough odds!
Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
What? You don't want me to get a job?
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
What thing? What is this thing?
Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Fine! Be murky!
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
What?
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
The man is showing brain.
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
You guys okay?
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Oh yeah...
I uhm... Well, I sang... well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
Actually about an hour and a half.
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
I've been here the whole time!
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
You put your balloons down!!
You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
What?!
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
But, we'll stay here with you.
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
No, did we miss it?
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Yeah.
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
Mhm-mh!
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Rossy, Rossy.
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Oh, that is so...
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
Very, very bad.
Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
To be nice.
Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
Dad!
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
I think you know.
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
What was all that about?
Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Okay! You take care!
Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
It's uh, $12.50.
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Did you just break the radiator?
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose.
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
As much as they love you?
Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
Hiccups.
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
No Santa? Was I bad?
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
We're so sorry.
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
So what are you gonna do?
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Okay, you wore me down.
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
But I...
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
What?! Are you crazy?
Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Right.
OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
Atta boy.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Why not?
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch.
But were fine.
Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
But my apartment is so...
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?
What are you doing here, Geller?
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
That's very funny. We done now?
Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
Yeah. Okay.
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Sorry.
We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize. Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
So did that do anything for ya?
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
It's an expression.
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
Yeah.
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
Damnit!! Did you move?!
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
Give me a 'for instance'.
See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
M-m.
Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think ... listen, listen!
Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
Noted.
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Tell him.
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
All right.
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Where ya going?
Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
What is it...? Please...?
Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
What? When was this?
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Hi.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
Oh, that is amazing!
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Okay, what's up?
Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!
No, but you know what I mean.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
I could die.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
What in God's name is that?!
Uh, just a sec dad. OK, be cool, just be cool. OK dad.
Let's show 'em.
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....

I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Ross!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Hi!
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
We were on a break!
Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
So, did you talk to Joey?
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Hey.
Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
So, why did you break up?
Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
What about Monica.
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Okayyyyy, open up!
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
Looks like it.
Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Well who would?
well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
WHAT! WHY?
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Say it... say it!
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Yeah.
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Oh come on Ross!!
C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
You know, we should just go, I'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
This place is awesome!
Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
I don't think they are.
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
Oh my God, what!?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
It really was. You've learned some new moves!
umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
WHAT!
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Only if you say his full name.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
There you go! Someone came!
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
Calm ourselves?
Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Do you know why?
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
When is Santa coming?
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
Oh, my.
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
That's funny.
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
So, uh, how was your day?
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
Where's my underwear?!
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.
Hey.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Ross? Let's go.
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Monica! Come on!
I'd lead with that. Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra .
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
This is just occurring to you?
Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
Can I get you another glass of wine?
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
Really?!
"... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Sarah.
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
You think about stuff like that?
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
Why don't you take Ross?
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Richard!
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
Whoa! I kinda liked it.
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
What does that mean?
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
Hi.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
How'd the lecture go?
You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani.
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Bye hon.
Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
No. Uch.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Noooo!!!!
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Why?
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
Oh, yeah go ahead.
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Hey! He beat ya.
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Hi.
No, I arranged that... Joey: Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
And that horrible museum tour!
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
What?
Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no I can't.
Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Uh-oh.
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Yes.
Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!!
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
And was the curse lifted?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Where were you?
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
What?
Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Oh, poor baby.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
Good.
No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
Did you get the grant?
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
She.
Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make... uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid.
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Monica.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
So, you're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you.
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Hey.
That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
You are so sweet.
Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Come here, I'll make you a drink.
SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
You dog!
Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
I'm not even... I'm not even...
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
How do you know about that?
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Hey!
No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing.
Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
Hi!
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
OK.
So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Yuh-huh.
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Oh stop that!
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Yeah, she never misses these conferences! No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Well, so what're you gonna do?
Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Why?
Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
I can't watch this.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Oh, just look at her...
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
What are you shushing?
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
Give it!
I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Dude!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
Hey!
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
You have dinosaur checks?
Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say.
Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
Yeah, but so is this.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Ross!
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Oh... Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene.
Nothing, I really wanna know.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
I can hop.
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Huh.
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
You don't?!
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
You do know that Wham broke up?
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
All right, we should call somebody.
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
Had the money in the wrong hand.
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
Wow, really?
And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
You know, I can't tell it again...
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Oh my!
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Fine, fine. We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.
Come on, I don't know what else to do.
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
Humiliating and noble!
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
Yes.
Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Uhuh.
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
All you had to do was buy the card!
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
What, he's 18.
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
Joshua.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
Yes, yes, you did.
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I knew.
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Not me.
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Oh, that's sweet.
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
I thought he was with you.
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Well yeah, but then...
Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y'know if we...if You're wearing the ring.
Yeah, maybe.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
I'm not Drake.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Course there, they just call it food.
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Ross.
Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Ross!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old.
Yes, it was.
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
Which time?
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Really? About what?
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Seriously?
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
Ross, don't start.
Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
You already hit on me an hour ago.
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
I can't remember which sister.
well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from the coffee house.
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
You're right. It was 37.
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Okay, bye!!
The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
I got nothing.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
...He's in.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
How do you know about this?
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Not right now.
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Yeah! Right!
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Hey, the fight's starting!
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Ross, cough drops, please?
Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
No, we went to the left.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
Oh my god, I left the water running.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Congratulations!
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Has it been that long?!
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
Yeah, sure.
It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Oh...
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Rock on! Phoebe : Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
I'm sorry!
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
You wear bi-focals?
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Yeah!
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll come back.
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Yes. Not out loud.
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
Uh, actually, that's..
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
So how did everything go?
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
And this- is my reward!
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
It's not all juice!
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
I could've been killed I hope you know!
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.
Look at this. My two best friends!
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
Yeah, well they suck too.
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
I wish I didn't have to go.
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
You're a genius, Ross.
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Define fun.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
What?!
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
What? C'mon, talk to me.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
I say push her down the stairs.
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
You're hurt!
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Alright, what are we gonna say?
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
He took my essence!
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Isn't that great?
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
No.
I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
What?
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
I'm leaving you.
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Huh ha ha!
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
He's getting married tomorrow right?
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Then what's gonna happen?
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
Thank you! I know, though.
It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
Ross..
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Yeah!
Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
Hi.
Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
So, rocks.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
Absolutely.
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
You mean there's more than one of us.
Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
Alright, 5 more minutes.
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
Uh, just a sec dad. OK, be cool, just be cool. OK dad.
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
It's All Relative.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Oh.
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
Hello, Ross?
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
Six? You want me to join you?
Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Doorknob?
Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Yes dear.
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
I'm so sorry.
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
What is going on?!
Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
....Are we still talking about sex?
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Me either...
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
Do the claws again.
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Just a waitress?
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Yeah, don't push it though.
I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
Well, just wake him up!
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Ooh! Oh!
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
A-ha!!!
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
A part of him did yes.
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
And condoms are the way to do that?
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
I'll never get to be a best man!
No! No, you know what? You , the baby's fine, now squam . Yeah, story walking.
What ... Oh!
Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
Yes it does.
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Yes. Yes!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist.
There. Here's their card.
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Yeah!
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Well?
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
Ow! Ross!!
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
No?
I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
Yes.
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
It's a...
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Oooh!
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Okay, it must just be me then.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Ohh, absolutely.
I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
So, should we tell her?
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Yeah, take your time.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Chandler!
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
A big idiot.
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Is your back feeling better?
Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
Sorry. You look good too.
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Okay, they're just talking...
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
That's not how you really feel is it?
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Is he alright?
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Pretty much.
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
What?!
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
Can you believe they're still not here?
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Dance with your father.
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Hi! How'd it go?
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
So how'd it go?
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Excuse me?
Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
Hi Ross.
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Duly noted.
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
So, did you two have fun?
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
What?
When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
Emma.
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
Hit me!
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Who?
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Umm, yeah.
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
All finished!
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
I really think you need to go now.
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
What?
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Like a date type person?
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Yeah... for three years.
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
...and live forever as a machine!
11, unbelievable 11 is correct. All right, that's 4 for the guys. Ladies, you're up.
Uhh, 11!
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Were both of those Joey?
Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
I know!
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
Me too!
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
What? Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
And so engaged.
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Are you really not going?
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Oh b-b-but it is!
No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
What am I gonna do?
Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Art it is.
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Say it!
You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual.
What!? You faked it?
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Ross!
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Nothing!
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
That's funny. Who are they?
Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?
Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
Where have you been?
Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
Okay.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
Oh, Liam.
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Christmas eve.
Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
Me too!
Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
What happened to the library?
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
Hey! Oh!
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Who's singing?
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Hey!
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
You know, I think that's a good idea-our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. Bye, y'guys.
Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Hi you guys!
No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.
Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
No! Not at all!
Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
To be fair this one does have nuts.
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Weekend at Bernie's.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
I'm sorry.
Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
Yeah! I think that's great!
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
You're kidding, no!
I know I am! ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
But you are a real boy!
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
This should be fun.
I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Can we come in?
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
Did you cut this couch in half?
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
I understand that would be difficult.
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Ohh, ohh.
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Scotch.
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
Just washing the windshield.
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Your son.
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
Wow!
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
Yeah? Hi!
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
That's excellent.
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Yes sir.
Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Oh, we're not together.
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Uh Dad, Emma's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you.
Okay. Wow.
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
I have a gun.
See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Oh my God!
Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
Shake it off.
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Hi!
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
Look at you. All jealous.
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
: I thought we had them!
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
But...
Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good.
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Ross? You okay?
What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
Why?
Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
Yes please.
well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
Actually what?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Does it?
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Ah!
Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away"
Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
I wasn't invited.
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Yeah.
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
As in my grandmother.
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Love what you've done with the place.
Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage!
She was a drug dealer!
Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Ok.
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Why...why?
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!
Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
You're right! That did cheer me up!
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Fine with me.
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Oh my God!
I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
Ross, you don't seem okay.
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
Oh no! Why?
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Dude! He's right there!
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
This is your place?
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
And I also got... two more apples.
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
What!?
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Hi.
No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Was that Emma? Is she up?
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Here?! Now?!
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. The Lightning Round!
Yes!!
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
It's ok that's how you feel.
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times.
I wanna get married.
No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Oh, come on Ross...
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...
I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy"
Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Yes!
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Hey, kids...
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
Oh, hmm.
... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!
Homo.
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
How is it going with Charlie?
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
So?
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
I-I am Kristen.
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Pizza!
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Huh.
Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
May I help you?
I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Oh, he's just goofing around.
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Ross has a boyfriend.
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Well then I think that's it.
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
Hey!
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
It's really gone?
Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
Not good, Ron.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Marcel?
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Oh, okay, I get it.
Well, I-I better get to class Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?
That's it.
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
You gotta do it, man.
Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract Well, why are you laughing?
Umh... Kurts Baley?
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Oh I don't-I don't know.
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
We have a half hour.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Ah, so what are we looking at?
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
Ross, how could you let this happen?
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Oh, honey that's awful.
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
C'MON!
Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
It's never gonna happen.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
... And you called him Alby!? I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Yeah...
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
Ooy.
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Hey hey, come on in!
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Santa's mad at me.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Oh?
I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
All right, all right.
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
The country?
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
That is so unfair!
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
Who?
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Okay let's put aside that you "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
I said I didn't technically.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Alright...
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
And you're okay with that?
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Anything?
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Oh hi!
Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, umm...then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
Yeah.
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
Well, I have a PhD, so...
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
So he likes to break stuff.
Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
Why not?
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Okay.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
What's fish hooking?
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Who's your roommate?
If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Absolutely.
Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Damn it!
Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
Very cool.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Oh!
No I left the diapers at the hospital! There's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
Wow you guys got a hospital? Fancy!
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed.
Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Hey.
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
I can't believe she can out run you man!
The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
Why not?
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Sure. What's up?
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
What party?
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Professor Geller!
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
What?!
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Why are you doing this?
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
You go get that animal outta here.
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
You told them he was missing?
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Oh-oh, absolutely!
Respectfully, professor R. Geller. , closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!
Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
Well, I'm very impressed.
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
What's so bad about that?
Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
What?
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Hey! Hey!!
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Oh, let me see!
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Okay, Santa!
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Really?!
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
C'mon, Ross!
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
No, wait Phoebe.
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down!
Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
I see.
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
I'm really sorry you guys.
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
dammit!
Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
It sounds interesting!
Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
Hey!
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
I didn't know you guys hung out.
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Oh! Yeah!
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Uh-hmm.
But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.
Well, this is awkward.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Hey
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
What?!
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Hi! Remember me?
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Yeah, definitely!
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Between you and...
Alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic.
But, those are for you.
No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Just aim for the bump.
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
'Tonight' tonight?
Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Oh!
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
Ok.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Hey!!
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...
131!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Hi!
Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
Thanks!
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Ben, dinner!
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
Actually, I should get going.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
Really?
And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
I do love Mike.
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
Cute.
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Jack, would you let it go?
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Really!?
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
But I think we should tell her.
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Hey.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
No!
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Come on look guys, don't fight.
Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Okay.
Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Thank you so much!
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiance was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Could've been a peach.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
No, I do not hear that.
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
So what are you guys going to do?
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Come on, show me.
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
Bye, fat ass.
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then...
Oh. What's a lurker?
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
Yeah... Now I have something...
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.
Bye-bye.
oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Hello?
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Well no brush!
Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or...
Jen.
Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Yeah, his name is Ross. What?
Poor baby, you're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.
You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
Well, I've never gone this fast before.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
No, yeah, Ive done that.
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Oh that's right!
Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
You don't wanna win the lottery?
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Oh my God!
So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Yeah.
Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
H-Hi!! And you are...?
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
YOU! You feel!
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
And I have costumes.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Well yeah...
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
You weren't there!
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.
Score.
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Why?!
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
What?! What the hell?!
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
Oh God.
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Two, two babies?
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
What did they do?
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!
Mine was a humdinger.
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
No-no, it's really not huge.
no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god what's wrong with me.
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
God Ross, what is that?
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
We'll take Literature!!
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Hey.
Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
What's the matter?
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Your work makes me sad.
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
She really said that?
The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
All right!
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
Got a job on a river boat?
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
What?
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Am I in it?
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Oh that.
Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Phoebe : Hey, check this out! It's totally you!
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Oh, hey...
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
How could it not matter?!
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
Ross will do it.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
I just feel awful.
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
Yeah.
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Looks like that might come any minute.
Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
Anything but stew.
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
Who is it?
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Yaaaay!
Oh right, right. So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?
Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened.
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Ross? Ross?
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
I'll ask. Boohaki?
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
A-alright! I can do this.
Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
I like those odds!
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
These aren't suede. Charlie: Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
: Ross?
of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Oh God!
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
What's the matter Ross?
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Yeah.
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Last night.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
What?! Why did you do that?
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Thanks!
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Funny book?
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
No, come on, you know that's not true.
Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Oh, everything's pink.
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Ross, the heat!
Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Why not?!
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
No, he really said it.
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
What are you doing?
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Who?
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Don't call us that!
No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
What?!
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
Ohh, you're a freak!!
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
What is wrong now?!
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
You seem to really like her.
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... Only... only not creepy.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
No.
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel.
What are you taking amoxicillin for?
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Oh yeah!
Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Keep singing! Keep singing!
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Aren't you gonna...
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
Ross!
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and...I've been feeling.
We really are.
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
We could not, would not want to wait.
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
Ahh, nooo!!
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
It doesn't say that. Does it?
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Oh.
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Don't you want to know about the sex?
but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Stop what?!
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.
You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
I am those things, yeah.
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
Congratulations! Wow!!
You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Does anybody want anything else?
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Yeah.
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Vulva?
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
Look at that!
Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Grandma... grandma... grandma... Okay, I see you later.
I uhm... I completely understand.
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Yay!
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. That's a pretty necklace.
Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
So what are you going to do?
You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!
Ah! The high road...
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Okay.
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
Hey.
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
Why is 10 the highest?
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Ross...
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Oh, youre gonna be great!
oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
what's up is Phoebe ok?
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
Oh yeah!
It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. Ross: Oh my god.
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Uhh....
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
Thanks Ross.
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
No, let me explain! Fired!!
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Yeah, like a chimney.
You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Oh, put him on!
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
What'cha gonna' do?
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
C'mon!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
What?!
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Hey!
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
You don't trust him?
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
What about Andre?
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
What?
Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Was it really that good?
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Oh, that's um, interesting.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
No.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Ohh, it's time to go.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
Come on!
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
Ross, are you okay?
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
No.
You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
Really?
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Okay.
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
What are you guys doing out here?
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
What line?
I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Uh-huh. Good luck.
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Oh my God!
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty!
Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That's why they call them plans. Hello? I'm fine.
And you're Okay with that?
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Yeah.
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
Wait up!
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
I know. Thanks.
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Why not?!
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
He's fine!
Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
What?!
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Okay.
No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Yeah! Excuse me...
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Hey!
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet.
So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Do I know why we're rushing?
We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
No awareness.
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
Okay.
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
I think she's OK.
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
What was it?
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
If it helps, I could slide over.
well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer and he used to date Oprah.
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
That's easy, baggage claim.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! .
Wow!
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Not even on page 7?
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
Yeah?
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
God, what a mess.
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
What?! What else did he say?
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Bed?
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
At a fake game!!
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Why?
You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
And you know, I have a massage client soon.
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
You are mad!
I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
hmmm...
Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
Really?
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
What?
Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
I'm sorry.
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
No way!
Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Yes! There's still pie.
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up .
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so...
Sure!
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Well I didn't! I didn't propose! Unless uh... Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and...it does sound like something I would do.
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
What?
Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?
You blew them away!
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!
I believe I read that somewhere!
Wow! Wow, You look . . . uh . . . It's just, ah . . . That dress . . . uh . . .
Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
I know!
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
All right! Just hurry up!
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...
I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Really?
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
And I blame you too.
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
And now you're giving me the message!
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Thanks!
By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
What are you, what are you doin'?
And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
That's what I hear, yeah.
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Hi, how's it goin?
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Hey!
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Ooh, I've been better...
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Are you okay, sweetie?
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Pretty good! I told her.
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe...kinda...wanted ah...start...things up again.
Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Dead leg!!
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll meet you there.
Uch.
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Okay.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
Wow, that is tempting.
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
This is all of your things.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
It kills over one americans every year.
Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
You just finished?
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
Already?!
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
What're you doing?
Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
Look, if you did...
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
All right, so we weren't prepared!
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
So what are you gonna do?
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... "Can we walk"? Oh, you... you like that?
Worse?
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Ross.
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?
oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Aw what are you?! A detective?
No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
In the bank.
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
My job!
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
So, did you pick one yet?
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
Wait, so, you're going?
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
I was not and oh God, shh!
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
I beg your pardon?
No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
Well, actually it...
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
You know, he was just doing his job...
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Are they still looking for us?
This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?
Okay.
Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
So you're really okay with this?
Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
What are you doin'?
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Are you crazy?!
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
Look I just thought that...
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Okay.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Ross, we can handle this.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Hey guys!
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
But do you wanna get back together?
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
I'm sorry?
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
That you're a liar.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
We agreed on Minnie.
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
I don't want you to see me naked!
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
No.
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Anytime you're ready.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
I know.
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
I can't believe this is happening.
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Who?
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.
What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.
Oh-A.
No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
You're kiddin'.
None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn't tell anyone!
Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?
Are you still here?
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
No. No-no-no-no.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Do you want to know?
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Ross, you don't know that.
I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Hi!
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Okay, go ahead.
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Oh no! Oh no!
Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: "Oh, I knew all along"
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Yeah! Why?
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Yep!
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
that's why she was weird.
I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Let's see what else he'll do!
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
It's locked.
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know...
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
What's that?
Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
What do you mean?
No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
What kind of an emergency?
I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"
Oh my god.
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Look at this.
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Hey, what are you doing here?
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
He could be in disguise, y'know.
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Joan?
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Thank you.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Whatever.
Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? Ah, oh, ah! Ah! The same thing happened again!
Ok!
Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .
It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
Oh my God.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Are you serious?!
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: "Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-a-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
but you did say it.
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.

Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
Great!
And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Not to mention the cold sores.
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Dad!!
Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
I always loved that!!
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
Why should we?
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
You wanna get out of my face?
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
She's in her room, why?
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
Really?!
What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
What, what incident?
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
Hey!
Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
What is it?
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
What?
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
I don't know, it's just...
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
There we go!
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
I think on some levels she already knows.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
It's laminated!
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
Oh.
I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.
Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
It's all right. Sweetheart.
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Oh!
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
All right!
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Where are you going?
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
I was.
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Yes, please.
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
Wow.
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Sooo!! Anyway...
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Awwww!!
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
You've been married twice?
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
What?!
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
That's nice.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
I did.
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Yeah, you're right about that.
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Walls are pretty thin, guys!
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
Oh shout, that would have been fun.
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Oh yeah, no, what's that?
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Thanks.
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
Yeah, no, me neither.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
No, answer his.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
Who's Barney.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
That thing is not coming in here.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Ross, it's too hard.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ... but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids.
Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going.
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
You fell asleep?!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
Ugh!
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
I did.
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
What is that?
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Yeah.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
I won, hey!
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
What the hell are you doing?!
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
What is he doing here?!
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
It's Richard Burke.
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Kinda. Oh my God!
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
So it's okay to date a student.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Ross, there he is.
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Why would I be mad?
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics... you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
You were?
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
Aren't you with that girl over there?
I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
What did, what did he say?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
No, no, no!
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
You have a son?
No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Oh, was it awful?
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
See?
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
By someone besides Monica?
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". An option that many of my students use. Shall we?
I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Ross?!
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
No way!
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Oh, but it's made her so happy.
She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
What, the blonde with no bra?
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
But like how?
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Hey!
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Alan.
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Do you not see it?
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
It so does not!!!
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Howdy partner!
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Texas?
I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
That's insane!
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Man, I gotta get a kid.
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh so-so not really never.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
You obviously can't keep away from her.
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Well it's very unsettling.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Hey! How's Ben?
She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
Oh, What's the matter?
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
I'm sorry... Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Do you always have to bring him here?
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
Services? Oh, services.
That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Sorry.
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Oh good.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
She asked-asked you out again?
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
She laughed at you?
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
How can I help you?
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Of course I do.
Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. . GO, GO, GO!
Or we could throw you both in now!
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?
I'm outa here.
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
All right, Ross!
Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Oh, Ross...
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
Hey!
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Well what is it?!
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
Hi!
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
No it's not.
This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
Sandy made Madeleines.
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Whad'ya mean no?
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Ohh that's so sweet!
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
How's it going with her?
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
What did I just say?
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Well, who wouldn't?!
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
I didn't know that.
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
You do? Why?
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Alrightalrightalright. There.
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
What?
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
I get that a lot.
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
A pill?
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
No luck huh?
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
Like what?
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
You could say that.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Ah, you... have the sex?
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Nice!
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Easy tiger.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Yeah?
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
I think she would like that.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Oh, really?
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Why?
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Did you see Betty?
Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
Hey...
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
Yeah.
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
That's a good call. Right.
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
No. Why?
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Are... are you OK?
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Yeah.
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
What?
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You've been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me.
Whoa, how do you know about that?
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
What?
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
Yeah, sure?
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
What!? They are totally ripping us off!
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
That one will.
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?
And the eye!
But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone... ... when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!"
Wonderwoman!
No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
Maybe you should put it off.
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
God, Susan is so fun!
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
All right, buddy!
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
Uh, Ross.
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
No?
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Oooh that may be a New World's record
Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
What are you talking about?!
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Yeah, I do.
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
Meeting Julie.
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
What?!!
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Yeah.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
You can watch our tape if you want.
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Well, that's great.
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
All right! Bring it on, you...
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Come on. I want to know.
Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
That is so sweet.
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
No you robot!!
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
The hot chicks?
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
That'd be good.
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Yeah, they're not so bad.
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
What?! Why?!
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
What do you see? What do you see?
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
We have heard you play.
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
He should take the sack?
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Duh!! Christmas!
Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
Really?
Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
Really?
If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
Seriously? You divorce-o?
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
Yeah right.
Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.
Dude, none of this is cool.
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
Hey.
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Really?!
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
A sandwich?
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.
You've being seeing someone?
You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Are you actually saying these words?
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Oh no, you're the best.
O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
That must have been hard.
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Oh.
Alright, ok, let's do it. Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Ugh.
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
See now it feels like Christmas!
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
Yeah! Yes!
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
Not interested.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
We'll be waiting for you...
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
Really?
No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Uh-huh.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Barbados!
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
This is ridiculous.
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
Well maybe he was nervous.
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
Great! Thank you very much.
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones... fossils!
Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
Ross...
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
Oh dear God.
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
Right! Okay.
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
There is not one hair on that head.
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
Yeah.
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Do I still call you Ross?
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
1 minute 50 seconds.
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
You're going to China?
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
That is neither here nor there.
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
Doctor Ross Geller.
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
We've only known each other for six weeks!
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
Mmm-mm.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Goodbye Geller.
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Seriously, where did this happen?
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. Ross: What did you get?
Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
What's happening to your accent?
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
Ubb.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. Yes we were! Yes we were! Come here gorgeous. Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever!

I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get... Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...

It's like the cheapest college ever.
