Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
You know, we should just go, I'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
I'd lead with that. Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra .
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
"... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
No, I arranged that... Joey: Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no I can't.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
So, you're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Yeah, she never misses these conferences! No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Oh... Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
Fine, fine. We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y'know if we...if You're wearing the ring.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old.
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Rock on! Phoebe : Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll come back.
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
No! No, you know what? You , the baby's fine, now squam . Yeah, story walking.
Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist.
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
11, unbelievable 11 is correct. All right, that's 4 for the guys. Ladies, you're up.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
What? Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual.
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?
Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
You know, I think that's a good idea-our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. Bye, y'guys.
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
I know I am! ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Uh Dad, Emma's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you.
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good.
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away"
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage!
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!
Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. The Lightning Round!
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times.
No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...
Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.
Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Well, I-I better get to class Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract Well, why are you laughing?
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
... And you called him Alby!? I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Okay let's put aside that you "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, umm...then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
No I left the diapers at the hospital! There's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Respectfully, professor R. Geller. , closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!
Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic.
No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then...
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.
oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or...
Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Poor baby, you're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Phoebe : Hey, check this out! It's totally you!
"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Oh right, right. So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
These aren't suede. Charlie: Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... Only... only not creepy.
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel.
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and...I've been feeling.
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Grandma... grandma... grandma... Okay, I see you later.
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. That's a pretty necklace.
You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. Ross: Oh my god.
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here.
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That's why they call them plans. Hello? I'm fine.
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer and he used to date Oprah.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! .
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so...
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
Well I didn't! I didn't propose! Unless uh... Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and...it does sound like something I would do.
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!
Wow! Wow, You look . . . uh . . . It's just, ah . . . That dress . . . uh . . .
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe...kinda...wanted ah...start...things up again.
I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll meet you there.
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... "Can we walk"? Oh, you... you like that?
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?
Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.
No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.
No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn't tell anyone!
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? Ah, oh, ah! Ah! The same thing happened again!
Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: "Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"
Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-a-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ... but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids.
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics... you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". An option that many of my students use. Shall we?
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. . GO, GO, GO!
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You've been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me.
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?
But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone... ... when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!"
No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.
You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...
Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Alright, ok, let's do it. Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones... fossils!
Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. Ross: What did you get?
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. Yes we were! Yes we were! Come here gorgeous. Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got... You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. Big baby butt! I like big butts. I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get... Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm... My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon... I'm a terrible father!
