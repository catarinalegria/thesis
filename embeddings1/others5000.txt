Oh wow, this feels weird.
I don't know where the phone is.
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
"Oh, my, god."
Huh ha ha!
My God! What happened to you?
No! I'm so happy for them!
Is he romantic with her?
Honey that sounds like fun.
Just sit over there!!
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Well, I'd have to say gay.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
I didn't know there were docks.
Oh! What's new in sex?
Yeah. A year ago..
Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
No Joe, no miracle.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Probably just the first half.
I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
Thank you. So are we good?
Tag? Hi, who was that?
You are soo enjoying this.
Oh honey, but it is just about...
What?! You got us evicted!!
Oh yeah? Since when?
Well, h-how is this like that?
Her dancer friends?
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Did you just break the radiator?
I don't want you to see me naked!
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Then what? What do you want?
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
Wha. . . hey!
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
She asked-asked you out again?
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
What?! She made the tea!
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Oh my God! That is so good!
What thing? What is this thing?
What are you, what are you doin'?
Okay, should we get some coffee?
Joey asked me marry him.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Well, then can we meet him?
Joey! Come here! Come here!
We'll be right back sir.
Ooh, your brother. Score!
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Well try to keep it down.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
We're paying for this y'know.
"Yeah." "Me neither."
"Yeah." "Me too."
4 o'clock. Food?
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Well, I would like to have the option!!
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
I didn't know you guys hung out.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
He's not having an affair!
Oh please, they're having sex.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Maybe you should put it off.
Where the hell've you been?
Do you wanna play football?
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
Come on! I think this is funny!
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Say more things like that.
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Because he's stealing from me!
Okay. Let's use this brush.
Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
All right!! Fine! Fine.
Do I have my own castle?
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
You want me to see a therapist?
Huh.. How about 600?
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
She-she died Jill.
Did-did you take these back?
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
Not even one more time?
We have to get her a present?!
Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
I know, I still need to talk to you.
You put these on my desk!
Three of your five, what?
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
So what are you guys going to do?
Joey, where are those bags?
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
You remember when we got these?
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
OK, then get me your purse.
It's open! Hi, Joe!
God I'm just a horrible person.
She you in the parking lot.
So, uh, how was your day?
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Aww, look at the little thing.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
You give me back my Walkman!
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
You were gonna drink the fat.
I think you should drink the fat.
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
What is this? Ross, what is this?
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
So now what have we agreed?
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Monica, will-will you marry me?
No-no, I'm staying put.
You guys wanna get some coffee?
IF you hold a spider.
Because I knew you were lying!
Whoa, how do you know about that?
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
What song was that, Pheebs?
So you know how to fix it?
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
What? You really think she's hot?
How did it go with Erin?
But we should move quick.
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
No so we're protecting her.
That is the Coast Guard.
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Oh wow! This is so cool.
Really! That-that great huh?
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!

I don't really care about the Knicks.
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
We are looking at a Playboy.
Awww, just like his daddy.
No. A break from us.
You let Joey drive it?!
Let's dry 'em again.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Oh so-so not really never.
Oh come on, I already went.
Oh, look at her, so happy!
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
No, I think that was the whole all.
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
Really?! You think that will work?
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Okay, well, we won that one.
What is this? What are we doing?
I didn't know you could get married here.
I said it's still nap time.
Oh, oh. . What is this?
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
So now, what are you doing here?
Ross, there is no us, OK.
Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
You stole them from me!!
It'll be a short one.
So maybe something in an office.
Alright! Enough out of you!
Ok. If you really need to.
Monica, where did you get these?!
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
You've being seeing someone?
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.

Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Eh. Beth dies.

Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Well, look at that, same thing.

How'd it go with Pete?!
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Ooh great! Very Monica.
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
No, was he any good in it?
Turned out it was a hat.
You're out of Diet Coke.
You're out of toilet paper!
Throw in the duck too!
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
I want the little round waffles.
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Hi, hi can I help you?
What-what are-what are these?
Well why didn't you take the job?
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Take it like a man, Ross!
Ross, what is taking you so long?
Why would I have to sleep with you?
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
You dont even have cats.
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Oh no! Not me! Emma!
No, it was just the three of us.
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Happy New Year, Joey!
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Men just take out wind?
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
I can't... I can't hear it again.
What're you guys doing out here?
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
Oh God, I really had a good time!
I think it could be kind of great!
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
What?! What else did he say?
Oh... what an interesting name.
Yes. You're not asking are you?

Why aren't you home yet?!
Pretty uhm, different huh?
Excuse me, there was no time!
I don't get this! She was horrible!

Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
I - I have to get on the plane.
Okay, what? What is too sensitive?
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
All right, it won't come off!
No, you could've lost your job.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Which one do you think she is?
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
Op, ice. I need ice.
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Well then I demand a recount!
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
And... taped back together.
We love you, we're here for you.
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
How is that the silver lining?
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
How often do you read it?
We got some really great stuff!
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Wh-You dated my sister!
You're a pathetic loser, right?
I am so hot for you right now.
Shake that nasty butt...
Well, that's because of a lot of...
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
What? Oh my God! To who?
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Could tonight be the Night?
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
She dropped off a casserole?
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
You want me to talk you out of it?
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Joey, did you my face cream?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
That's because he's on your neck.
We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Hey, how'd the interview go?
She didn't hang up either!
She didn't hang up either...
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
With ah, extra anchovies.
Can any of you watch Emma?
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
No you really think that's what it is?
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
I don't care about any of that!!
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
No its really okay... Monica!
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Does anybody want anything else?
Well, I-I could live without it.
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Ok professor or detective?
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Well look, if you don't like this...
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
And a crappy New Year.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Ok Monica: We will!!
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Yeah well unless we tell him.
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Can somebody please go in?
High-five, the babies are coming!
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Wow. She does that a lot!
No. I was just going to do this myself.
Then what's with all the bananas?
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
Not even with your best friend.
Jurassic Park could happen.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
You are ready to make a commitment!
Would you excuse me for a second?
Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
You really think it would be that different?
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
All right. I'm a total pro!
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
I did not know you spoke French.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Oh, I read that in high school.
Okay! All right! How was she?
We took our apartment back!!
Well, I brought the next best thing.
You're just staring into space.
Time is money my friend?
Uhh, we still need a tip.
You went shopping for fur?
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
I've never lived like this before.
Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
...It's kinda hard though!
I could not have done this without you.
It was only 500 bucks.
You just did a little dancy thing.
Now that she broke up with you?
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
And Monica, what are you going to make?
And all these people actually died?
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Does anybody need more coffee?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
And your fly's still open...
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
So did you break up with Joanna?
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Well, then so you just invite me...!
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Were both of those Joey?
God. You seem really, really nice.
So umm, what's this book about?
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.

How have you never been on Oprah?
Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
You all know? Does Ross know?
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
It depends on who asked.
Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
No! God, would you just calm down!
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Any sign of your brother?
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Oh my God! My dog died!
Because I promised Mindy I would.
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Well what is it? Let me see.
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.

What...how is it going with Drake?
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!

I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
But he has to know how I feel!

Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Wow, he must like you the best.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
What? You don't want me to get a job?
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Geez Ross, you could have showered.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
Ball? There is no ball.
: We have apple cinnamon...
Why-why aren't you more excited?
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
So, did you shave your legs?
Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
So it would just be, me alone?
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
What, the blonde with no bra?
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
All right are you guys gonna come down?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
I know, I can do more than cook.
Let us keep the apartment and...
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
So you eh, you talked to Joey?
So how's it goin' with Joey?
No matter how much we want it.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
She won a thousand dollars!
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Of course, I'd be honored!
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
Foot rubs for a month!
It's over! You have to accept that.
Come on, they were not that huge.
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Nah, I don't really want her to see.
He doesn't speak much English.
No-no, they're not very nice people.
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
You didn't break up with that fireman?
Oh my God you stole her award!
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Uh. Did you call your parents?
Hey, that was an honest mistake!
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Time's up, now your dead.
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
And that makes you angry because...
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
You are asking me to be your wife!
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
"Dude, Where's My Car?"
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
Good day for married people huh?
There's no room under the bed.
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
How long do cats live?
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
Off to see young Ethan?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
I got a really incredible job offer.
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
And stop saying that! I hate that!
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
That's a line from the show too!
NO, no science camp!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
So can we keep this between us?
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Your fly is open, Geller.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
That's weird, she locked the door.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
I mean it's the end of an era!
Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
Come on, I don't know what else to do.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
What, what's it, what's going on?
I'll help you throw out your purse.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
You would do that? I never get picked!
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
And you really think this is a good idea?
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Look, either help me or go.
I haven't seen him in so long!
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
I thought you only met him once?
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Okay that is the one we already have!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
People are trying to sleep in here!
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
That almost hit me in the face.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
You never come into this office again!
How many guesses do you get?
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
What? Shut up! We're winning!
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Who are you saying "check" too?
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
It's not? When was she born?
Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
I mean he just started going out with her.
Take the top down did ya?
I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Since when do you watch the news?
You have a play date with a stripper?!
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
See? Now, he could date her.
You can't, because of the new skylight!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Good, good, good, good, good.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
How about 600 and these earrings?
What? What's what you were afraid of?
Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Hi mum, put her back on!
It... You can so totally tell.
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
Hey, they were popular when I left!
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
This is how I would hold a football.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
I'd need an expense account.
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Isn't that a line from the show?!
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
"Yeah. That works for me."
I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Well, there's two spots left right?
Just give us our apartment back!
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Call her! Call her now!
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
All right, then you owe me $350.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
So, um, will you bring the truck?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Get your hands out of there! No!
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
We are so gonna find them this year.
Who ? Joey: Me.
Amy! Yes I do.. I really do.
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Okay, that we may be able to do.
Hello? Who are we spying on?
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Well now it's an empty bar.
Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
I am. Let me just get my coat.
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
That is neither here nor there.
Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Well those are very popular frames.
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Somebody got in late last night.
No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
To get you to make out with him!!!
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Can you come here with me for a minute?
Are you seein her again tonight?
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
I know. It seems smaller somehow.
You know, he was just doing his job...
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
So were you guys together a long time?
Aah! Why? What are these for?
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
So, will I like any of these guys?
Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
He's perfect, he's never been better.
Okay, calm down, here they are.
You took the same class twice.
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
That really is something; that's really cool.
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Wow! If only more people knew.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Do you even know who Kip is?
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Sure! God, please take those off!
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Ah, did I leave the stove on?
The meeting with the guy went great?
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
How could you not tell me you worked here?
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
You promised you would break up with her!
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Do you even know what a vicar is?
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
No way. No way did you do this.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Why on earth would I understand this?
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
All right. What's your news, Amy?
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
You too. Last night was just wonderful.
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
How-how did you lose your job here?
Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
What am I making him by the way?
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Did you at least win the contest?
Some uh, some visual aides.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Ross? Can we just close the door?
Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
So, whaddya think George is like?
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
They had to have that specially made?!
Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
W-What are you, what are you talking about?
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Can I please be there when you tell her?
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Well then why did you give me a ring?
You need to learn some new slang.
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Why does it matter so much to you?!
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Babies don't care if they're slim.
At his apartment. Is this juice?
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
What...that scene I saw was so good!
What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
What? You just click when they click.
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
If we broke up, and I lost you...
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Oh my god, I left the water running.
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Guess who we ran into today?!
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
That's right! You do what the hand says!
That yeti is one smooth talker.
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
There isn't. There is totally isn't.
Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
I tried! They won't take her back.
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Not unless different means the same.
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
He's coming over! He's coming over!
So do you think that my dream means anything?
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Oh God. It seems like forever ago.
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
Got a job on a river boat?
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
There were times when it wasn't even me.
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.

Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!
Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
All right, well how much time do you need?
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Well-Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
You put holes in my baby's ears!
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
We got locked out of the apartment, we ...
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...

And you were at this job for four years?
Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.

Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
I'm the hell person whose office this is!

Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Why do men keep talking to me like this?
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!
How come we have one extra place setting?
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.
Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up .
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
You are the official baby crier stopper!
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Your agent called. You got that audition.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
It should be right next to my plane ticket.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
The job is in Paris. FADE OUT.
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
We ended up having sex in his chair.
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
These are from Halloween three years ago.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
It's a standard issue bra clasp!
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Can you please, please take care of it for me?
Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
But can it... just... happen a little bit?
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
No, she was just much better at job than me!
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
So, does this come in another color or...
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
There is a hardware store right down the street?
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
You like that? Let's take this into high gear.
Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
NO! Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay.
Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
So uh...I guess we should...make it official huh?
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Your company has a fine foods division?
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits.
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
I am sorry, I don't know, I am sorry, I don't know why I did that!
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
It really was. You've learned some new moves!
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
It is our first official date. Our first date.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.
Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?
I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
