this was carols favorite beer she always drank it out of the can i should have known
im divorced im only 26 and im divorced
that only took me an hour
you know what the scariest part is what if theres only one woman for everybody yknow i mean what if you get one woman and thats it unfortunately in my case there was only one woman for her
i honestly dont know if im hungry or horny
grab a spoon do you know how long its been since ive grabbed a spoon do the words billy dont be a hero mean anything to you
yknow heres the thing even if i could get it together enough to to ask a woman out who am i gonna ask
i assume were looking for an answer more sophisticated than to get you into bed
you got a job
the word youre looking for is anyway
come on you made coffee you can do anything
cmon cut cut cut cut
no no i gotta go home sometime
no no no go
okay you know you probably didnt know this but back in high school i had a um major crush on you
oh listen do you think and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out sometime maybe
i just grabbed a spoon

i i think theyre great i i really do
do you remember the ludwins the big one had a thing for you didnt she
aw mom
im not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money
dont listen to your mother youre independent and you always have been even when you were a kid and you were chubby and you had no friends you were just fine and you would read alone in your room and your puzzles
look there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars with his museum and his papers getting published other people are satisfied with staying where they are im telling you these are the people who never get cancer
and i read about these women trying to have it all and i thank god our little harmonica doesnt seem to have that problem
okay okay look i uh i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me and so well heres the deal carols a lesbian shes living with a woman named susan shes pregnant with my child and she and susan are going to raise the baby
well yknow these people are pros they know what theyre doing they take their time they get the job done

look i dont wanna make any trouble okay but im in a lot of pain here alright my face is dented
hey this heyy
i remember the moonlight coming through the window and her face had the most incredible glow
look its just a little more complicated
little louder okay i think theres a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didnt quite hear you
my first time with carol was

not that big a deal its amazing ok you just reach in there theres one little maneuver and bam a bra right out the sleeve all right as far as im concerned there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close am i right
multiple orgasms
not even say breaking up with janice
oh yeah last week you had a wonderful nutty chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing nothing just just im fine
that guy he burns me up
so uh rachel what are you uh whatre you doing tonight
oh you uh you wanna hear a freaky coincidence guess whos doing laundry there too
me was that not clear hey why dont um why dont i just join you both here
yes i do have a laundry room in my building um but theres a rat problem apparently theyre attracted to the dryer sheets and theyre goin in fine but theyre comin out all fluffy anyway say sevenish
ok bye well monicas not coming its just gonna be me and rachel
its laundry the thinking through is minimal
so whatre you saying here i should shave again pick up some wine what
ok ok now what is wrong with my snuggles what it says im a sensitive warm kinda guy you know like a warm fuzzy bear ok i can pick something else up on the way
was your basket on top
no suds excuse me hold on a second thats my friends machine
hey hey hey thats not the rule and you know it
all right shows over nothing to see here ok lets do laundry
well thats because youre such a sweet gentle uhdo you uh do youoh hey uh you must need detergent
uberveiss its new its german its extratough
rach do you uh are you gonna separate those
rach have you never done this before
uh well dont worry ill use the gentle cycle ok um basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites a whole nother machine for colors and a third for your uh your uh delicates and that would be your bras and your underpanty things
uh that that that would be a judgment call
that does not sound stupid to me you know its like the first time i had to make dinner for myself after carol left me im sorry thats all the time we have next on ross uhoh
uhoh uhoh the laundrys done its uh its a song the laundry song that we sing uhoh the laundrys done uhoh uhoh
nothing nothing leelo the laundrys done
all right all right its just that you left a red sock in with all your whites and now everythings kinda pink
yeah uh except for the red sock which is still red im sorry please dont be upset it could happen to anyone
you got the clothes clean now thats the important part
what a beautiful story hey im fine by the way
oh shhh shh magic is about to happen
is it feels like two
he could never get a woman like that in a million years
no of course not yeah yeah it is
well yknow monogamy can be a uh tricky concept i mean anthropologically speaking
fine fine alright now youll never know
alright theres a theory put forth by richard leakey
oh yeah nobody knows and were not supposed to ask
oh cmon when we were kids yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasnt raggedy
alright you madcap gal try to imagine this the phone bill arrives but you dont pay it right away
because youre a kook instead you wait until they send you a notice
monica youre mom
cmon seriously joey whats the part
youre right youre right it isso you gonna invite us all to the big opening
look at it this way you dumped her right i mean this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful intelligent unattainable tell me why you did this again
no what happened big guy
it felt like a big guy moment
yeah i mean i think when its your shot yknow youyou know its your shot did it feel like your shot
she is a kook
and officiating at tonights blackout is rabbi tribbiani
pheebs what about you
disneyland 1989 its a small world after all
the ride broke down so carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children then they fixed the ride and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom
well it was the only thing to do there that didnt have a line
and you didnt marry him because
probably but you know ill tell you something passion is way overrated
it is eventually it kind of burns out but hopefully what youre left with is trust and security and well in the case of my exwife lesbianism so you know for all of those people who miss out on that passion thing theres all that other good stuff
but um i dont think thats going to be you
uhuh see i see big passion in your future
no no no im not in the zone
im taking my time alright im laying the groundwork yeah i mean every day i get just a little bit closer to
i will i will see im waiting for the right moment what what now
were shushing because were trying to hear something listen dont you hear that

look i really need some help okay why why did i have to speak in a british accent what do i do
theyre not listening too me
monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing
all right keep going we are phasing the accent out phasing it out so without out retesting the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis  were there any questions at this point yes
come again whatswhats this nonsense all right imim not english im from long island i was really nervous and the accent just uh just came out im sorry so if we could just get back to the lecture umm were there any questions about paleontology all right look i was just trying to make a good first impression obviously i screwed up but what you guys think of me is really important because imim hoping to get a permanent job here so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
well hello rachel

ohoh absolutely
its just my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then and then there was a lot of waiting around
notnot really thththere was just carol
no she kept kicking me away
oh i a lot of stuff
a little yeah i made a snack
just a sandwich turkey a little mustard
thatthats always good news are you okay
didnt you spend last night at joeys
look ii dont know whats going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker look can i just say not all men are like that
hey there are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work okay there are some men who will stand by andand watch as their wives engage inin what only can be described as a twosome with somesome woman she barely knows from the gym
men i guy i know
she is not shes gay oh my god she is so gay i cant believe this
im sorry your husband cheated on you
try telling my wife that
hey remember when i had a monkey
yeah what what was i thinking
whats up with the greed joe
well isnt there something you can do to earn a little extra money i mean cantcant you pick up i dont know an extra shift here
oh wait wait dont you have an audition today yeah maybe youll get that job
after one class i dont think so
well of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming thats not enough look i studying karatay for a long time and theres a concept you should really be familiar with its what the japanese call unagi
no its a concept
all right maybe it means that too
yknow what fine get attacked i dont even care
unagi is a state of total awareness okay only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you
all im saying is its one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other whole another story being prepared for an attack i dont know like a surprise
all right you know that one was coming but that doesnt mean you have unagi
danger danger
a lesson in the importance of unagi
perhaps now im curious at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass
im sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point but ilook i just want you guys to be safe danger ahhh huh unagi
chandler i sensed it was you
unagi im always aware
oh why dont you make her one of your little jokes
yknow what shedshed love this uh its an exact replica of apollo 8 i made it in the sixth grade
yeahyeah except apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon but youyouyou could write that umm your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely
its not something you are its something you have
yknow what i can easily get out of this but there is a chance you can get very very hurt
its a great class
yeah yeah i was watching umm hey a couple of questions though umm about thatthatthat last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor whatwhatwhatwhat would you do next
no nono no what would you do next
i tired attacking two women did not work
no i mean its okay i mean theyretheyre my friends in fact iii was married to one of them
oh no nono no i tired but i couldnt thats why im here maybe we could attack them together thatthats a no
ahha nowhere to run
hey i just got uh my teacher evaluations check out what this one student wrote i loved dr gellers class mind blowing lectures dr geller you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department
oh i wish i knew but the evaluations are all anonymous
its a girl anyway it wouit wouldnt matter okay because im a teacher and shes a student
no but it is frowned upon
besides theres a big age difference
i know when im 90 shell be like 80 and it wont seem like such a big difference
oh thank you thanks very much ow
oh i i donti dont think that would be the best idea

so lets decide on the spending limit
i was thinking more like a hundred
we have 800 reservations at grammercy bistero
i am dressed
i have an oily tzone
uh actually i sent the flowers before the actual date so techincally technically i didnt break any rules thanks for stopping by though
oh yeah what are you gonna do

so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes
oh yeah its fine i guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control
hi its nice to meet you i used to have a friend named joey i dont anymore

wait a minute were you on a poster for gonorrhea
hey you leave marcel out of this
heyhey have you ever locked yourself in a tv cabinet vd boy
probably around gonorrhea
yeah laugh all you want but in ten minutes were gonna have younger looking skin
and it was ernst muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the velociraptor would expand its collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten its predator yes mr lewis
just a high pitched intimidating noise
well wewe dont know for sure but in my head itit sounded something like this of course this is just conjecture okay thats uh thats all for today uh mr morse can i see you for a moment
mr morse i need to talk to you about your midterm exam im afraid ii had to fail you
well you need 60 to pass
nono its not whatwhat happened there ned

okay umm i uh im your teacher im sorry youreyoure a student and iand i like women in spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs
can i ask you something have you ever had a guy have a crush on you

i doi do not have a boyfriend theres a guy in one of my classes whowho has a crush on me

ititthe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm
yeah i guess i can cut him some slack
yes mr lewis how can i help you
and why exactly would i do that
well thats different okay because he he was actually in love with me
i cant believe someone would do that for a grade
uh mr morse can i speak to you for a moment
