sometimes i wish i was a lesbian did i say that out loud
tuna or egg salad decide

yes please dont spoil all this fun
look ross you gotta understand between us we havent had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento you however have had the love of a woman for four years four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out and that is why we dont do it i dont think that was my point
stay out of my freezer
angelas the screamer andrea has cats
if can invade poland there isnt anything i cant do

did you make it or are you just serving it
kids new dream im in las vegas
okay so im in las vegas im liza minelli
yeah i think for us kissing is pretty much like an opening act yknow i mean its like the standup comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out
the problem is though after the concerts over no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again yknow i mean were in the car were fighting traffic basically just trying to stay awake
oh i think this is the episode of threes company where theres some kind of misunderstanding
oh uh that would be mine see i wrote a note to myself and then i realised i didnt need it so i balled it up and now i wish i was dead
yes and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a childs pillow

what does she do
well no although i did have an imaginary friend who my parents actually preferred
i dunno but i think its about to attack the enterprise
