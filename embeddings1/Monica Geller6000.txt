okay yknow what im not fine im not i mean how can i be fine hearing you come in with her she wants to see your bedroom yknow what what if were friends who dont see other people
why not i mean this has been the most amazing week would it be so terrible even if we were friends who lived together or maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends and vowed to be friends forever

oh chantal
thatsthats not phase three
wait now what am i doing again
joey let me ask you a question what does this light switch do
didnt it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did
they wouldnt have put it there if it didnt do something how can you not care
this switch thing has been driving me crazy so i turned it off and checked every outlet now four of them dont work which means one of them has to be controlled by the switch so i plugged in things in all four of the outlets thatthat make noise so that way when i turn it on i just follow the noise and find out which one it is
yeah well im using noise okay all right so is everybody ready here we go i hear something i hear something where is it
he asked you out
electrical plans for the building
i know that switch does something okay soso i went down to city hall and got these all i had to do was pay 25 and wait in line for three hours
oh just some pictures i made and hung up i thought theyd brighten up the place they do dont you think
i know that theres no hole there i just really liked that picture
okay but there is a wire back there i mean that switch is connected to something
i just thought that if i could follow the wire i could find out what it did
no it disappears back there behind that baseboard for a minute there i thought it went downstairs
but it didnt say hello to mrs chatracus
all right the super couldnt figure out what it did a 200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did ive had seven pretty serious shocks i officially give up
i guess joey was right it does nothing
aww honey im sorry
i dont know how museums work in england but here youre not supposed to take stuff
oh no two days you must be bummed
and lucky means more cleavage
or if you want to kiss him umm you could use mistletoe
or spin the bottle
two in a row youve got to use your tongues now
oh my god have you lost your mind
rachelrachelrachel ii cannot i cant let actually i kinda want to see what happens
i think youre done
well at least im going to mute it
oh why didnt you take her
you must feel horrible hey the guys have free porn
hey cheer up youre gonna see her again right
nonono dontdont do the accent youve got to see her again
because you could get to live out my fantasy
no yknow the fantasy meet someone from a strange land fall in madly love and spend the rest of your lives together
yeah that plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything
ohhh i knew you loved her then you need to go to the airport and tell her youre probably just gonna catch her just as shes about to go to the gate youre gonna call out her name and say i love you and shes gonna say i love you too and you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss everyone at the gate will applaud
then you two can can sneak into the cockpit and things will start to heat up and then a stewardess comes in ive been watching too much porn
how did it go with frank and alice
ohh did you do what i said diddiddid you tell her
and well what did she say
oh youre totally welcome whatd she say
it is not over youre over
it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you and the reason why she couldnt is because her feelings were so strong it scared her now you go home and wait for her call she could be calling you from the plane come on now go go
phoebe they didnt make you pay for those knives did they
this isnt how its supposed to go there cant be another guy
of course theres another guy this is even more perfect now you have to prove your love
you have to go to london
yeah you have to go fight for her
when rachel was with paulo what did you do
you sat back and let him have her you didnt fight at all am i right do you want the same thing to happen with emily
all right then go fight for her go to london i mean that could be you and emily that butbut nicer just go to london
come on surprise her show up at her doorstep dont let her go without a fight
thats sounds great but how are you going to afford it
oh my god ross are you in england was emily surprised
all right when is when is the next flight out
okay just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesnt show up by then then just come on home
what are you doing here you cant be here
oh you came to tell him you love him i knew it i was right im right right
yknow what it really creeps me out choosing other peoples sex clothes
well youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts wild nuts wild rice roast asparagus and salmon au croup
yeah you were but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant and then you realised if you bitched about it then you would stop cooking and you would have to make your famous baked potato and diet coke
so you wore your nightie to dinner
emilys straight
this totally makes sense
oh sure it does in high school you werent jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you
look all were trying to say is dont let what happened with carol ruin what you got with emily

yknow what i am really tired of your bellyaching okay ii worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live

i thought that was a good thing
yeah theres one right under the cabinet
why do you need it

the baby shower for phoebe
look what i got look what i got look what i got can you believe they make these for little people
okay look at this one this is my favourite
i know phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these
because shes not gonna get to keep the babies
wait a minute unless we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant likelike umm regular coffee tequila

i mean youre the one theyre gonna come to when they wanna run away from home and the one they talk to about sex
guys hurry up the flight leaves in four hours it could take time to get a taxi there could be traffic the plane could leave early when we get to london there could be a line at customs come on
passport check camera check travellers cheques check
myself yknow for remembering to pack a thing yeah you do a good thing you get a check my mom does it i never realised it was weird
yep you got the tickets
okay if you need the vacuum its in my closet on the lefthand side ah the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
yeah okay give that a try
all right yknow what we really are late lets go lets go lets go
yeah yknow but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken and you wouldnt have to worry about the salmonella but of course with salmon youd have to worry about the chickenella so i cant wait to see this place youre getting married
okay i talked to the guy with the shovel and i found out what happened
they tore it down a few days early
dont worry youll find some place to get married
youre gonna find a place but even if  god forbid  you didnt so you postpone the wedding is that really so bad i mean think about it you could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want you could have tulips you could have salmon mmmmm salmon
but either way youre gonna get married youre gonna be happy my moms gonna like you better than me
oh god shes told you that already didnt she
yes i did and you are welcome
oh my god youre even dumber than i am

who two divorces and joey
yknow what yknow when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own well youre not ready for that

or it could mean thatthat you saw chandler and me together and we yknow were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too
well sure im just wearing sweats but thats good that youre not in love with me because you just want a girlfriend
you become friends after
joey i thought you were gonna try to be friends first

okay i gotta go find rachel but umm if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesnt seem so bad
ugh i thought you were rachel
i just tell her i have to get it over with i told ross and phoebe and shes the only one left
have a seat okay listen umm chandler and i are going to live together here
yeah hes gonna work on that
well be waiting for you
soon ii just couldnt before you saw how upset joey got i couldnt do that to her shes my best friend
im not your best friend
all right all right at least im prepared
these arent for you are you upset
rach theres something uh important i have to tell you
no but im throwing this shirt away i think there was a little misunderstanding before
umm when i said that uh that chandler and i wanted to umm live together we meant alone together
oh no sweetie no this is my fault i wasnt clear im really sorry and listen you take as much time as you need to move out okay theres absolutely no rush
okay dont you want a cookie
maybe do you need a tissue
i made them
so i i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us
really well yeah surprisingly well yeah she didnt cry she wasnt angry or sad
i mean all im asking for is just a little emotion is that too much to ask after six years i mean what areareare rachel and i not as close as you guys i mean do we not have as much fun dont i deserve a few tears i mean wewe told joey he cried his eyes out
hey so um i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff
yknow no point in dragging it out dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore
hey rach what about this huh whowho gets this see i dont know if i want it because it might be yknow too many memories
i dont know hey rachel you want the big plate i want you to have the big plate
something to remember me by
but still its a big change the end of an era you might say
im fine i just im thinking how much its an end of era
an era is defined as a significant period of time now it was significant to me maybe it wasnt significant to you
what is the matter with you why arent you more upset arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore i mean arent you gonna miss me at all
whats hard to believe
rachel its going to happen chandler is gonna move in here

yeah sweetie

this would be a beautiful place to get married yeah but i wouldnt put the aisle there and i would never have the ceremony there i mean youd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch
what are you crazy im not getting married im not even engaged
well i mean i guess there is no harm in putting my name down
phoebe that stuff is
what ii bought groceries i was gonna make you dinner
oh please he didnt hear it he didnt hear it
the woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and chandler heard i know how bad is this

chandler please dont think i was trying to pressure you phoebe and rachel
it was a mistake please dont take this to mean anything because it doesnt
im gonna go tell joey that that youre back i was really worried about you
yknow i only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up and one of them is sex
i dont know ive never had to use the other one im just saying yknow if were having sex hes not gonna be talking
oh we have some
ross let me ask you a question all jokes aside where is this relationship going
do you really see this as a longterm thing

chandler whwhy dont we sit down
and so were hiding in the bathroom
so i hide in the shower and the next thing you know theyre going at it right on the bathroom floor
i thought you were going out with elizabeth
oh ross sometimes grownups have commitments they just cant get out of
why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff i mean thats what i did when i first weighing stuff
if the school finds out youre fired
shes leaving for three months
look ross the only question you need to ask is do you see a future i mean like do you see yourself marrying her oh my god you did it already you married her didnt you
okay well i thinkthats your answer
why do you want to see my hand
i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes
what are you up too
well thats a little crazy although i am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the internet
why to celebrate your relationship to solidify your commitment to declare your love for one another to the world
okay well thats good to know
sure i love this part
ohh oh thats okay i hate when people come back to complement the chef like i have nothing better to do so whats up
oh good to see you too did you come down here to tell me that
what uhwhat did youwhat
yknow youre really not supposed to be back here

i cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night
its monica open up
i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together but i must warn you the night that you announce your engagement im going to announce that im pregnant
im sorry i almost made you sleep with ross

thats it take it take it take it
they cant all be bad find the one where you make your bedroom eyes ohh there it is
do you really want to pull at that thread
chandler what were you thinking
hey guys check it out my mom sent me the paper
yeah we really do
wow imagine what our kids would look like
okay the reason why i asked you guys out to brunch today is because i have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor
first of all um i love you both so much and youre both so important to me
well umm i was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other like hypothetically if phoebe were mine
if phoebe were my maid of honor
rachel would be phoebes i would be rachels that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset
well thats the best part umm you guys get to decide
because then i dont have to
im really not deciding
yeah hey a weird thing happened today whey i was at brunch this woman overheard that i was marrying you andand then sheshe wished me good luck
no its more like a good luck
she was like 30 dark hair attractive
come on was it somebody maybe you dated in college
oh my god yes who is she
did you break up with her
you broke up with a girl because she was fat
well apparently she does
chandler chandler i just figured out who you are
youre lewis posin
lewis posin he was my best friend in fifth grade andand then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no do you know why
no but because he thought i was to faaaaa and every time i think about it it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade yknow ii really think that you should apologize to julie
no i know but yknow what it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me
its pretty clear
why dont you just stop doing stupid things then you wouldnt have to apologize
all right ii have to ask
are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again
well you broke up with julie grath how much weight could she have gained
in one year my god what did she eat herher family thats not the point
well thats not the only time this was an issue you remember when umm you spent thanksgiving with us you called me fat
what if i have babies okay i mean im gonna look different im okay with that but im not sure that you are
even if i shrink down to two inches tall
ohh wow thats great oh wow we really have to start planning i have i have a lot of really specific ideas we should probably get together like four times per week you can come over to my place well get together before work what do you say 630 my place im so excited
she sent the chicken back again
well fine i want to meet this chicken expert send the colonel in
lucky bastard janice
well she saw the ring
well she was shocked when i told her but then again so were most people
well she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself named clark uh she also kinda invited herself to our wedding clark too
well she corned me she asked if the wedding was in town i mean what was i supposed to do
come on so she comes to the wedding i mean it wont be so bad
oh my god shes not gonna like the chicken that night either is she
soso you wouldve just lied
would it really have been that easy
good so do it saturday night because were going to dinner with her and clark
he might still show up
its actually going to be just family
janice what umm what are you doing here
our kids are gonna call her aunt janice arent they
yeah ininin the bathroom
well justwell just let her stay
kinda like your barca lounger
i never stop thinking about it
oh my god oh my god you have to go
because chandler still has feelings for you
thats right thats right and that is why you cant stay here tonight and probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding
i mean i realize that his feelings may never completely go away but you can
its a stupid game and i wasnt playing against other people so technically i didnt lose
nobody cares about the dakotas
cause you invited your assistant
oh why didnt you tell me i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin
now you think i wouldnt enjoy that because it is so fake but i still do
all right im out of oven space im gonna turn on joeys please watch him do not let joey eat any of the food
hey did you guys know that your oven doesnt work
ross im gonna use yours okay
chandler can you give me a hand
rosss apartment is nice how come we dont hang out here more often

phoebe why is there a dog in our apartment
phoebe theres a dog sitting on my couch
yes there is hes black and white and shaggy and hes sitting next to rachel and licking rachels hand
phoebe phoebe open up
oooh i wish she could stay here but chandler is allergic
chandler if that dogs been here that long and you havent had a reaction maybe youre not allergic to this dog
dont do what
really id say 3 to 4
when its your assistant i would say never
please dont listen to joey okay would you look at him hehes obviously depressed hes away from his family hes spending thanksgiving with strangers what he needs right now is for you to be his friend
okay phoebe we should probably go back now
stop it stop okay lets go we can be strong
oh my god did you hear that she said monica oooh i cant leave her

ross that is so sweet of you to get phoebe that bike when i heard the story i almost cried
oh yeah i saw her walkin it down the street the other day she had uh these flowers in the basket it was so cute

im sorry i cant help you see rules are rules
no kidding out of towners huh what did you tell em
some people have been saying its yknow little drops of heaven but whatever

so im not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy im gonna spend the rest of my life with
your mother told you this
the woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13
honey as we get closer to the wedding is there anything that you would like to talk about or share
youre wrong the centerpieces are fine do you ever get scared at all
doesnt it ever just freak you out thatthat youre never gonna be with anybody new again
just i love you so much justits just sometimes it bothers me that im never gonna have that feeling yknow when you meet someone for the first time and its new and exciting yknow that rush
okay but all right youre a guy does it not freak you that youre never gonna sleep with anybody else
even with me
come here come here sweetie you dont have to worry no besides yknow what im gonna have a lot of new things with you the first time we buy a house our first kid our first grandkid
yeah but a part of me also cant wait til its over chandler and i have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding
hey phoebe will you give me a hand
i gotta make up the guest bedroom hey cousin cassie is coming to stay with us a few days
ross shes 25 years old
subtle guys
i know youre planning my surprise bridal shower
hey what did you decide to do about the movie
thats what you say about porn
no no you should a lot of major actors do nude scenes i mean the chance to star in a movie come on
plus everyones gonna see your thing
oh boy me too
the wedding is off sloppy and immature
okay but wait we cant my cousin cassie is in the guest room were supposed to have lunch
shrill the wedding is back on
cassie needs to stay at your place
because purvry perverson over here cant stop staring at her
you were staring about eight inches south of there
she looks exactly like aunt marilyn
wafer thin ice
so to get this part you cant be
but you told them you werent
wow wow and its definitely all gone theres nothing there to work with what were you thinking
joey this is not like learning to ride a horse this is like learning togrow a turtleneck
oh my god what are you gonna do
well this may sound crazy but there maybe something we could fashion
well im not sure yet but umm of the top of my head im thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat
well uh im trying to make something for joey do you mind if i raid your fridge
okay all right turkey eh that wont work cheese that wont work olive loaf i hope that wont work
no its umm more like a wrap okay so uh im gonna go guys
i guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present
okay we have a lot of options here a number of prototypes for you to try on
yeah okay this one is a mushroom cap umm this one is made of bologna
oh just until the glue dries
now these areare more realistic but perishable
okay over here we have pink suede which is nice but umm if it gets wet then you know its gonna shrink
i also did a little something in fur but umm thats really just for me okay so why dont you go into your room and try these on and well seeget a better idea of whats gonna work
what are you trying on now
what which one
phoebe rachel its monica i wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice oh
you alyou already had it
well no wait a minute thats not true no what did that was really sweet and it kinda works out for the best
well now i get to spend my shower with the only people i really love i mean i get all those presents without having to talk to people i dont even like
wait a minute she isnt shes not the one who you
they were lovers
okay so this is where the band is and this is where the bar is and all these pins have peoples names on them and rach here you are
okay the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours
chandler relax its not a contest certainly not a close one
okay i think thats it the seating chart is done this is our wedding they all look like theyre having fun dont they
oh lets see wellif this is the wedding hall then umm youre parents will be at home in queens
why would they think theyre invited
rosss parents are my parents
oh please you just want more blue pins
all right all right maybe i can fit them in if i just do some rearranging but uh rachel may actually have to sit at the bar
hey oh goodgood youre here all right i figured it out im gonna take two tables of eight im gonna add your parents and im gonna turn them into three tables of six okay and i called the caterer i added two extra meals we are good to go
