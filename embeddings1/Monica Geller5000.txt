Oh that's so sweet.
So then you know?
How do you do that?
Yeah, we really do!

That is never good.
Isn't that great?
What about the closeness?
You're on the phone!
What did you just say?
And that would be?
Between you and...
What were we thinking?
That is not true!
Is someone there?
What-what are you doing?
I won the game.
It's pretty clear.
I hate this game!
We're sorry honey.
I love you too Chandler.
Phoebe moved out.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Not even close.
Oh, I love museums!
How was that possible?
No she hasn't.
Do you all promise?
You can not do this.
Oh, you're a grandpa.
Oh, this is so great.
Do you not see it?
I was always Joanne.
I'm crying here!!
What're you gonna do?
That's a good idea.
We'd love too.
You look great too.
Well, what did you do?
You're an opthamologist.
I'll be right there!
Like a log.
Like a pirate?!
I can't promise anything.
Oh yeah right!

Isn't this great?
So, did you do it?
And it's a magnet!
I'm really not deciding!
Well, no. But...
What's wrong Phoebe?
What are you doing here?
Just...please tell him.
Phoebe, what's the matter?
We owe you?!
That is so sweet!
Oh, you look so great.
No time for that!
You had a salad.
No, that's not mine.
Does so count!
You're not a senior?
After the snap!

Maybe I could do it.
Y'know what's weird?
What are we gonna do?
There's our star!
No! I'm not okay!
Why would you do that?
Oh, put him on!
Ok, then just go.

It's okay, it's okay.
You didn't find her?

How much longer?
Why do you need it?
Hey! There you are!
You don't have the guts.
You're not on TV.
Well, what's the part?
It's Joey's birthday.
Oh, God forbid.
Chandler what do you say?
Was he crying?
Shut up, Joey!
Oh yeah? When?
What-what's going on?
This was your idea?
It's gonna be so great.

Wow, is that Michelle?
What? I don't see anything.
What are you up too?
Aww! I love you!
Kinda. Oh my God!
He could hear me.
We're not doing anything.
I don't think there's anything.
I hope she's OK.
I can't go to lunch!!
Okay, this one I like!
Rachel always cries!
Joey that is horriable.
Honey, we gotta go!
No, I'm-I'm serious!
Mmmm! It's good!

Over here dad.
Oh, I already have one.
I'm so happy for me.
So we're back on?
You keep saying that.
You're meeting Richard?
Could you not look?
I guess that's how.
No no no no.

Would you please go?
We'll talk later.
Really?! How much?!

Shh!! Wait, what?
I can't believe you did that.
And six others.
Joey, do you work here?
How did work go?
What the hell is this?
We both do that!
Don't worry about it.

There's my little boy.

I totally forgive you!
I'm so happy for you!
No. No, thank you!
Are you okay, sweetie?
Hey, what's going on?
Ohh, how is he?
Oh, that'd be great.
Why would we do that?
I don't know why I'm here.
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Umm, well, he's...
Okay, I'm not getting this!
It doesn't say that!
What's going on with you?
I mean, was it Gina?
Oh, that's sounds great.
Phoebe, that stuff is...

The head tilt?
Ohh that's sweet!

Thanks. I think you got it!
Hey umm, what's this?
Oh my God! What happened?
Joey, what's going on?
Why is Ross naked?
I think I need a drink.
'Kay, here you go.
Run, Phoebe, run!
Wow, this really sucks.
What's the big deal?
You have to go to London!
Are you sure you're okay?
I don't have an atlas.
You bought a boat?
Don't you have to pee?
Joey that is so sweet.
Hey! I didn't know either.
You know what? You're right.
Then what's the problem?
Oh, honey, the earrings...
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Anything but stew.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
My surprise party!
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
W-wait. What is that?
I gave you one job!
Okay. I love you so much.
Well Rachel's not here!
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
All right, you're hired!
You really think this is okay?
Can you blame him?
What? We could do it!
The oven is on.
Wait! What about Joey?
The fake kind!
Hi...May I help you?
What happened to Janine?
...I can imagine.
What?! Which one?!
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
God, you are so strong.
Are you through with that?
Oh, then go Vassar.
One two three.
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Light still out?
In like a half-hour?
I saved you a seat.
What the hell happened?!
You had no relationship!!
Are these the shoes?
Chandler, what were you thinking?
It's good to see you too.
Happy birthday dad.
Okay. I-I can't watch.
Okay! Ohhh no!
No! You can't do that!
Can we come in?
Lots of responses.
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
I was frustrated with you!
I lost our mattresses.
Damn! It's empty!
Thank you so much Phoebe.
Fine, go have sex.
Another good point.
Okay, well I do know you.
I never knew that either.
Yeah, no, me neither.
Hey! How was sailing?
Alright, we have to talk.
What can we do for you?
Are we still on that?
'I am Bea.'
Joey, promise me something.
What is going on with you?
Hey, where is everybody?
Rach? What are you doing?
All right then. Bye.
What kind of changes?
Well, you're-you're sweating.
Anybody lose this?
Eldad, this is Rachel.
This bottle opener.
Oh May 15th.
Rachel, that's all we do.
It's like two miles!
He doesn't have anyone.
What? I didn't say anything.
That's not even a game!
No, I really, really do.
Oh no, wait! Joey!
You're Lewis Posin.
I know, it is isn't it?
Huh, wanna bet?
I'd do anything for you.
What are you guys gonna do?
Oh my-Oh good God!
Give it. Give it.
I do not like that woman!
Uh-oh, it was bad?
So what're you gonna do?
I am. I'm that stupid.
How did you get in here?
What's Phase Two?
Oh my God! I love that!
Honey, there's a reason.
You'd better run!
And you're not gonna do that.
Not now, I'm sick!
Where were your parents?
Okay, okay. I hate this.
What did they do to you?
How-how did that happen?
Go! Go! Go!
Would you just open it?
I bet this will work!
That's Bill Clinton.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
I'll take care of it.
Mine? Right here?
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
What's that supposed to mean?
Yes, you are so smart!
Okay. That was her right?
I-I-I think you look great.
Have you seen Chandler?!
Oh, she's gonna love that!
I can't! I have to work!
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
Nope, she's perfect.
Good for you, Joey.
Ooh, and I can do this.
He asked you out?!
I love this friend thing!
Are you guys gonna be okay?
You don't even know me...
All right, be my guest.
Oh my God! I love him!
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Thank you soo, much.
Oh my god good?
He hates to lose.
Man's got a point.
Yes you did. Absolutely.
You flicked me first.
Um... hi there.
I'm just easing you in.
I need to get some Richard.
He's... our age.
Y'know, I never saw that.
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
Oh boy me too!
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
A couple of days.
You're not supposed to look!
No, she's out shopping.
No, none at all.
No, I will not cave.
I know. I just can't find...
And his puppet too.
Them?! Who's them?
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Give me the good stuff.
What took you so long?
Waaay too special.
Hey, I know I what I want!
What was the dream about?
Well, get it off now!
I'm not your best friend?
Joey, speed it up!
You used to have carpet.
How's it going with her?
So what'd he say?
Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
Oh and you know what I want!
What's hard to believe?
So, how'd it go?
So what are you gonna be?
Shut up, I'm happy.
Very good, so good.
That's insurance fraud.
Oh, why is it unfair?
You're kidding?! That's great!
And who laminated it?
No, here's your mail.
Eh, you work for that.
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
I'm getting married next!!
God Ross, what is that?
You didn't know that already?
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
Why is everything different?
How does she do that?
I really need to talk to you.
Why do I have to decide?
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Okay, here's your penis!
But my clothes are-ohh!
We won't. 300?
Are you sure this time?
Well no, but um.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
Ross didn't scare you?
Well what did you send?
Guys, what's going on?
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Would you look at them?
Did you just flick me?
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
Why would I have the keys?
Here, let me try.
So what's Phoebe like?
No, I haven't seen him.
Just waiting for you sweetie.
What? It's still going on.
Hey! How's it goin'?
We're switching rooms.
How are you still single?!
You have dinosaur checks?
Why don't you just call her?
I can't believe he did this.
Ooh, this always happens.
So I'm kissing everyone?
Hey! Don't be a baby!
I mean really, think about it.
I can't believe you bought this.
Yeah, well, is that better?
Who are you talking too?
You have got to go home!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Happy New Year.
No. I hate this part.
No, I just talked to them.
I mean don't you trust her?
Oh, here's a great one.
Know when to stop.
What the hell are you doing?!
Well you should be embarrassed.
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
But we can go, right?
Well, apparently she does.
I thought she just had one.
How who wears it?
He took my snack!
What are you guys doing here?
That sounds like Nana.
This is so much fun!
Regular or decaf?
Rachel, how did this happen?
What happened to your teeth.
Come on, no peeking!
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
Sure! Okay, you go first.
The best man? Wow!
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Ok, here, watch this.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Alright, alright, alright...
Oh.... my... God.
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Not at these prices.
No that's, that's okay.
So do them for free.
What are you trying on now?
I am, aren't I?
Oh, an old glove?
You really ok with it?
...What did I ask?
We all chipped in.
In...in two weeks.
Oh my God it's old!
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Wow! You are really fast!
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Oh no! What's the matter?
Rach, here's your mail.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
I'm changing out of this.
What's fish hooking?
Pheebs, how's it going?
What is the worse part?
All right, check me out.
No really, they're OK.
No. See you don't understand.
Why did you hire me?
Hey, it's good to see you!
Y'know what? You are right?!
What's wrong with PBS?
It's so good, isn't it?
Barry who you almost...?
Thank you. They're yours.
They've arrested Monica.
OK, um. Goodbye.
Worked like a charm.
Well, maybe you don't need them.
And he's a great brother!
So, are you ready to go?
Well, what about his family?
Put your head back.
And that's Pete's Mom.
I am not high maintenance!
Oh, god help us.
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
Gotta keep squishing.
Ah, the other Jack.
Well, thanks, we like him.
It's a diaper commercial.
Or incredibly offensive.
This is all of your things.
That can't be your father.
What's with all this sand?
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
You're a really good kisser.
Well you did a little bit.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Thunder being stolen!!
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Now, open your eyes.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
This doesn't feel weird!
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Was it really that good?
I got you the foot massager.
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Who the hell are you?!
Yeah, but without the costumes.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
I thought that was a good thing.
Okay, what's going on with you?
Yes! Have you seen it?
Hey! Good, you're home!
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
Can I ask you a question?
I wanna wear this everyday.
I'm so glad you liked it.
So you had fun, huh?
Why, how much is that?
Rachel locked the door.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
How about Mockolate mousse?
That doesn't seem fair.
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Then why are you laughing?
Then why are you smoking?
There were only twelve.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
Oh, wait a minute honey.
Does anybody want these?
You did a minute ago!
Come on Rach, let's go.
It's Monica, open up!
Wow! You made a profit!
God, what is wrong with me.
Yeah, that's a big step.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Well, you're not working either.
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
It's almost our anniversary!
Hey! You're wearing pants!
Hi, nice to meet you!
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Well, bye for me too.
I would love to do it together!
I highly doubt that.
Hey, Rach, how was work?
How was your first day?
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
Where do you want to start?
Ross, thats my jacket.
We're with you. We got it.
'I drink tea.'
See he's nice. Right?
What is wrong with you?!!!
Y'know, just be there for her.
Well, I was having a conversation.
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
How'd the lecture go?
Chandler, why are you doing this?
No, just a Friday night.
Let's get the show on it!
Awww. But still no.
I never stop thinking about it.
Look at you. All jealous.
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
This is my favorite part.
Well, what am I going to say?
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Oh, now you want a pad.
Is it the Italian guy?
Honey! Dinner's ready!
I'll pick it up for you!
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
What are you doing with those?!
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Well, she saw the ring.
What else did you think about?
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
And who pays for that?
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Rachel said everything was okay.
He's gonna eat the cake!
Yes that would be lovely.
That was gonna be my opener.
All right? What's going on?
Never done that before.
You want some help with that?
Why? Because of the government.
Here's your tea Phoebe.
No Phoebe I am mad!
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
You can, I know you can!
Ross, we can handle this.
Oh, did you catch him?!
His dancing partner?!
His indian name?
That's what you say about porn.
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
He's retiling my floor.
Wait, he's not here yet.
So, did I hear Poconos?
Now calm down Joey.
Just uh, do the right thing.
Joey, we have something to tell you.
So how does it look?
Stick out your tongue.
How desperate am I?
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Still smoking cigars?
It's for their own good.
It's hard for some people!
He is right, isn't he?
That is sooo not true!
From here to the airport?
Then why did you move?!
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Really, is he a swimmer?
So um, who was she?
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
All right, so what do you say?
You look cute in bubbles.
You realize what you are don't you?
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
Sure, I love this part!
Not as each other!
Oh, there's banana on it.
Yes, you're having a boy!
What? Why, why would...
Hey, aren't you up next?
Oh man! I did it again!
Does it involve clogs?
Does it involve travel?
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Are you serious? Oh my God.
You really think that'll work?
We are not going to whistle.
Let me ask you a question.
I so wanna be attracted to you.
There's more beer, right?
Oh my God, it was incredible.
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
Why did they get divorced?
In case it happens.
So, what are you saying now?
Okay. Let's bring it in.
How'd you pay for them?
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Hi.. how was the game?
If you want, I'll do it.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
That's a good call. Right.
And slept with the professor.
Did she leave a number?
How about, you're moving!!
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Well, we certainly are alone.
Yeah! She's right in there!
This isn't even my dress.
Yep! You got the tickets?
So have you called her yet?
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Because then I don't have to!
I can't believe you're getting married!
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Well then get it, get it!
What are you smiling at?
I do not have baby fever!
Well...I'd better get going.
Who wants it? Anybody?
This totally makes sense!
Just the matter of ...payment?
She will be after tonight.
How-how are you, Mom?
We'll be waiting for you...
Did you break up with her?
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Some moms do that.
Oh well, where is he?!
It's 9:30 in the morning!
Well, it just seems that...
You stole them from me!
You're plans were with us.
What were you doing in Africa?
Makes me wanna puke!
You painting his toenails?
What uh-What did you-What?!
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
So! He'll understand!
Viva Las Gaygas!
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
That's what it sounded like.
So'd you guys have fun?
Oh, is everything in the car?
But you told them you weren't?
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Yep, we wanna get married!
So-so there is no party.
You become friends after?
Oh, So you can move them!
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
I feel terrible, I really do.
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
I used to wet my bed.
I know. I need more pie.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
I don't know what else to say.
Really? Your work laugh?
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Or Spin the Bottle?
That was a terrible throw!!
How 'bout just a boom?
They're still in my coat.
That noise you just made?
Wafer thin ice!
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Ross, I thought you were over this.
I don't know, clean places?
Let me get you some coffee.
Joey look it's really sweet...
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Men are such idiots.
Score!! 7 to nothing!
We are! Help us!
We have got to wash that!
We haven't eaten yet!
No, I just, I fell down.
The green dress? Really?
You just carry that around?
Okay, I freaked out a little.
I can't believe we're living here!
Too strong for me?
Just some stuff for the party.
What are you doing with the lamp?
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Well, who's voice was that?
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Well, uh, I ate some.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Pete's breaking up with me.
We checked. A lot.
Why else would we be here?
Does it have to do with Joey?
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Lucky bastard! Janice.
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
So, where do you want to go?
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
I was in too much pain.
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
When did I sign for it?
Nooooo. You're really not going?
You're not gonna mess it up.
Score! Now can we go?
Yeah, well they suck too.
So you didn't leave the bank?
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Why don't you just take it with you?
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
How, how did that happen?
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Your mother told you this?
Two girls and a boy?
Pass the cheese, please.
You need to give him money.
The baby shower for Phoebe!
I'm so glad you liked them!
Come here. Okay, be right back.
You're not just saying that are you?
You know, a party, or--
Wow, you worked in a mine?
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
You're so efficient. I love you!
Something to remember me by!
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
That's that weird voice again.
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Could not be more terrified.
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
We didn't order cake.
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
What?! You slept with Jason?
Why isn't it working out?
Wasn't there a little song?
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Ten dollars an hour.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
You did it! You got ordained?!
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
You still work at the multiplex?
What are you the memory woman?
I'm gonna set them to my time.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
Okay fine, now Ross...
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
And well, what did she say?
That's it! Dinner is over!
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Oh, no no no no no.
007 gets all the ladies.
Ross's parents are my parents!
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
And I would have to say pah-huh.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Did you just smell my hair?
Not a basset, a bassinet.
Really? Who's number two?
Okay well that's good to know.
You're kidding! Where? Where?
See? It's no big deal.
All right, what's goin' on?
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
It might be kinda cool.
Because the winner gets this!
Soakin' up all the culture.
We're never gonna find anybody.
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
Joey! You didn't even know her!
Just go get some! Go!
Who? Is that your sister?
Aw, it's soo unfair.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Love is the best medicine.
No it's not, it's second.
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
No, that is what the game is.
How? I don't have any money.
Oh, he's catching up to her!
All right, I guess we should go.
Well, I guess now we can't go.
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Oh, I ordered mine first.
You al-you already had it?
Then I won't have to kill you.
I can't find garbage bags!
So, should I call him back?
I told you not to go down there!
Put all my money in me.
Do you want me to pick you?!
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
All right, I'll try not to.
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Do you know anything about women?
Okay, can we please go eat?
Why don't you just go out with her!
See if he has ice.
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Haven't we made this decision?
Did you go home and change?
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Then why would he say it?
You owe me 20 bucks.
He might still show up.
So-so you would've just lied?
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Yep! And lot's of it!
I thought you could use the help.
Please, guys, we have to talk.
We'll put buckles on it.
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
You wanna get out of my face?
Are you saying I smell bad?
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
I used to love to play restaurant.
Excuse me, where are you going?
Did you make brownies today?
You guys, I am not that bad!
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
Does that smell bother you?
What did I tell you about the hall?!
Rach, did you check the machine?
Twelve dollars an hour.
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
That's probably what they'll say.
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
We're switching rooms again.
That's-that's not Phase Three.
About a half an hour.
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Why are so mad at him?
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
So she's a woman! So what?
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
What, he doesn't like Josh?
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
What is it?! What about Pete?
You just wanna each take one?
I can't believe you let them win!
The second sister dies?!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Just go over and say hi.
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Cause I already invited her.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
You're not gonna be phased out!
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
We didn't give you any money!
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
That was a half an hour?
This woman's living my life.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
That's right. Did you hear something?
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Oh, look, he's waking up!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
It's actually going to be just family.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
OK. Just for a little while.
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
I'll get back to my new job.
No. He's not a horrible guy.
He's totally flirting with you too.
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
And this goes for all guys?
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
You start working on that list.
Ross, he's got the remote again.
I've gotta get back in the game.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
This is not the bed I ordered!
But you live here! You know that.
It was a really beautiful service.
She lets you borrow them.
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Anything larger back there?
What kind of karate is that?
My parents will be so happy.
The wedding starts at six.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
I'm talking about me having a baby.
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Do you think he knew I was here?
Why do you want to see my hand?
What a minute, what did he say?
What if I turn out the lights?
Okay, throw it straight this time.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
All right, we should call somebody.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
What? I-I said you had a-
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Ross, cough drops, please?
You gave her food poisoning!?
Pete, can I get you something else?
Sit down! We're winning!
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Oh, they-they sent me home.
We just want you to think it through.
Third door on the left.
I knew you were not okay with that.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
All right, I...I have to ask.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
So, what do you think we should do?
Electrical plans for the building.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Rach, come see who's out here!
Y'know which one was she again?
Yes. But all the other ones.
Hell no, we'll pay!
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
That thing is not coming in here.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
It's coming from the living room.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
They won't take you to the vet.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
So you hit her in the face?
Here, take a couple of these.
They have racquets don't they?!
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
It is not over! You're over!
How's the big anniversary dinner?
It's my New Year's resolution!
In 1981 you were 13!
Really? I only had two glasses.
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Oh, but it's made her so happy.
So how's it going with you guys?
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Okay, here comes another camera.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Pulling what? It's second down.
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Well, at least you scared someone.
As much as they love you?
Who are they killing off?
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
That's because I'm in front of them.
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
It's kind of an important one!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Well then we still have a problem.
Come on! I really need your help!
Oh my God. He threw up?
Why would they think they're invited?
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Your a poet and don't know it.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Okay, he's a senior in college.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's it big girl! Come on!
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
I'm just trying to spice it up!
So you watched the movies huh?
What if they get mixed up?
All right, what about the third guy?
Oop, your cake is ready!
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Okay that does sound like fun.
No, it's more like a good luck.
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
Have you found your dress yet?
Well there's not much we can do.
I have no idea what you just said.
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
I am so glad you said cooks.
Then all your stuff would be here.
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Our guy's a great dancer!
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Isn't he an architect now?
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Promise me you'll be careful.
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Please tell me it's his mother.
So you're free Thursday, then.
Well, why would she lie to you?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Which one was Pete Carney?
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
So what did you do today Pete?
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
No-no-no! We need something old!
Guys, you got your hair cut.
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
So, are you sorry that I told them?
007 has a fancy car!
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Do you know what's a bad idea?
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Never call me from that phone.
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
What?! You're going out with her again!
Would it really have been that easy?
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
I hate men! I hate men!
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
I gave you a key for emergencies!
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Well, how bout just her mom?
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
I have some pretty exciting news!
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
You still have feelings for me don't you?
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Did they just kill off Joey?
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
So to get this part you can't be?
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
She has to know that your not ready.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
I am good. I finished my book.
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
You've got to be smooth about it.
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Does he not make enough money?
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
We're gonna see each other naked.
Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Why do you care so much anyway?
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
I wish all guys could be like him.
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Chasing him all around the room?
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
That you're not funny or sexy?
Here you go. You can wear this.
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
I swear you said you had the keys.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
And you know what? We want a rematch.
I was probably waiting for it to open.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Okay! My turn! My turn!
I had to go with the odds Rach.
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Why is this car in my bedroom?
No he went out to get pizza.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
5 6 7 8!
But, I put some honey in it.
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
OK, I'll see you later babe.
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
Come here, I want to show you something!
I sure do! And you don't get one!
She's leaving for three months.
Is your tongue swelling up?
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
You got a callback too didn't you?
Yes it has! I made cookies!
I'll help you fix your sweater.
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
And some of us really have to pee.
Please tell me you're stopping now.
Joey we know you steal our food.
Oh, just until the glue dries.
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
I think you're better than you think you are.
Is he not cute enough for you?
Hey! My first review is out!
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
He didn't ask me to marry him.
Nah... not-not special enough.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Do you always have to bring him here?
You can spill. In the sink.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Well, I just caught the live show.
So it's okay to date a student.
What kinda things have you been saying?
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
And Mindy, your maid of...?
I know, but you have to open it today!
That really was some of your best work.
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Five more and I'll flash you.
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Hey, how long are you in the city?
I don't think mine likes me either.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Rachel! That was a library card!
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Why, do you write him a lot?
Can you go any faster with that?
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
You had no right to go out with him.
What, that little thing at the prom?
So the going for help went well?
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
God, look what I found in the drain.
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
I don't want things to change! Do you?
Demi Moore is not a he.
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Honey, we have been through this before!
You didn't even take off your pants.
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Hey, the man's dog just died.
The Luisa from home room!
Did you like learn about her family?
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
I know, but look at me all tan.
Strip Happy Days Game?
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Great, now he's waving back.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Come on, we can't let them win!
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
We were just waxing our legs.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
We, we just wanna see the end.
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
A kiss? What are you talking about?
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Me going out with Richard's son.
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
We do not have one of those signs.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Why? Do you have a report due?
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
And lucky means, more cleavage?
Have you even had a girl up here?
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
I guess they're back from their date.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Is there? Is there someone else?
Hello, people who do not live here.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Hang on a second I just got in.
Well we... we kinda broke up.
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Ross, she's 25 years old.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
And yet, we're still poking him.
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Home is Home Star stew.
That, you get? That, you get?
You can let some of them go by!
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
You've never met Bob, have you?
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
You still want to move in together right?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Ross they're really, really, really white.
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
People! People say it! Come here!
Yes but my mom got me this job.
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
She sent the chicken back again?!
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
Carol moved her stuff out today.
That cold makes you sound so great.
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
And the way she slaps all the time!
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Please! I made this game what it is.
Because we won our apartment back!
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Well good, here let me help you out.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Good. What made you change your mind?
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
That is so funny. Let me see that.
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
My God! Is this a gym card?
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Shut up! This place is a hole!
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
All right, look at my on the back page.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
He is the man in the black dress.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Shut up, and put my table back.
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
If the school finds out you're fired.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Because they'll know we've been listening.
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Why would the little girl creep you out?
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
No, only because that's the graduation song.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Can we just start throwing things in?
You know the words! You are so into this!
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
What about these? These look the same?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
How many kids were we gonna have?
When, when did-how, how did you...
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Not one that can pee on the roof.
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
So maybe we should just. . .
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
But you've only slept with two people.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
There is no alley behind Macy's.
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
Do you mind telling us what it is?
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
What about the part where he has rabies?
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Is that some kind of boat talk?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
You gave my father a lap dance!
And! We also have speaker phone.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
How much did ever really win before?
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Ok will do. So glad you came.
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
No because it-it didn't seem important.
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Or! A bakery delivery person.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Only if you say his full name.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
I know the code to his answering machine.
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
I have not been sick in over three years!
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
The park huh? A public place.
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Pick a number! That is your only job!
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
All right, then show me some manly moves.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
No! We only mess around at his place!
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
How about we play for more money, say 150?
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
They tore it down a few days early.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
All right then, your bra would still be big.
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
Who did we fight in World War I?
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
A small puff of air, now come on!
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
