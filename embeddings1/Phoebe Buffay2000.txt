maybe theres someone else
ok so this is pretty much whats happened so far ross was in love with rachel since you know forever but every time he tried to tell her something kind of got in the way like cats and italian guys finally chandler was like forget about her but when ross was in china on his dig chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel she was like oh my god so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back but what she didnt know was that ross was getting off the plane with another woman uhoh so thats pretty much everything you need to know but enough about us so howve you been
oh my god this is huge this is bigger than huge this is like all right whats bigger than huge
cause you know if you dont look good we dont look good i love that voice
oh ok how its been so long since youve had sex youre wondering if theyve changed it

i know im not but you are and i was trying to spare your feelings
im still on no
ok youre gonna have to not touch my ass
all right ok but but you have to promise that you will not be all like controly and bossy and monica about it
all right now some of you are gonna get cut and some of you arent but i promise none of you are gonna feel a thing
all right thats it i quit
yeah but this isnt the face of a person who trusts a person ok this is the face of a person who you know doesnt trust a person
would you relax i know what i am doing this is how he wears it
well he was a he in arthur and in ten
oh my god im sorry im sorry which ones demi moore
oh shes got gorgeous hair
its too soon to tell shes resting which is a good sign
im not gonna lie to you ross it doesnt look good i put a clip on one side which seems to have stopped the curling
your hair looks too good i think it would upset her ross why dont you come on in
oh yeah oh i can do that
you wanna do it right now
ok i just wanna be really sure this time andie mcdowells the girl from four weddings and a funeral right
oh yeah ok thank you
oh look at these hey ben just do it oh my god oh ok was that too much pressure for him
i cant i have to take my grandmother to the vet
monica she will kill you she will kill you like a dog in the street
woof woof
oh all right what did i have
oh no wonder i dont feel full
i went shopping with monica all day and i had a salad
um we went shopping for um for fur
yes and then i realized im against that and uh so then we bought some uh boobs
bras we bought bras we bought bras
ben dinner
duh i think i know how to heat breast milk ok
i licked my arm what
you wont even taste it
not even if you just pretend that its milk
oh i tasted bens milk and ross freaked out
come on it doesnt taste bad
you guys um i know that this really doesnt have anything to do with me but um i love you guys too oh i really needed that
you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason
i miss janice though hello chandler bing
ok its very faint but i can still sense him in the building go into the light mr heckles
im sorry but sometimes they need help thats fine go ahead and scoff you know therere a lot of things that i dont believe in but that doesnt mean theyre not true
like crop circles or the bermuda triangle or evolution
nah not really
i dont know its just you knowmonkeys darwin you know its a its a nice story i just think its a little too easy
yeah i just dont buy it
ok dont get me started on gravity
well its not so much that you know like i dont believe in it you know its justi dont know lately i get the feeling that im not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed
just dont look at this funky shirt
really you can actually see it
huh so now the real question is who put those fossils there and why
maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts
look cant we just say that you believe in something and i dont
what is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you no whats that all about i think i think maybe its time you put ross under the microscope
hes even kind of cute
id call that excessive
janice you called janice
uhoh its scary scientist man
ok look before you even start im not denying evolution ok im just saying that its one of the possibilities
ok ross could you just open your mind like this much ok wasnt there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat and up until like what 50 years ago you all thought the atom was the smallest thing until you split it open and this like whole mess of crap came out now are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you cant admit that theres a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this
i cant believe you caved
you just abandoned your whole belief system i mean before i didnt agree with you but at least i respected you how how how are you going to go into work tomorrow how how are you going to face the other science guys how how are you going to face yourself oh that was fun so whos hungry
ok i didnt see it because i was putting on my jacket but i uh want to believe you
uh huh why is that
chandler you called janice thats how much you wanted to be with someone
well i mean im not married married ya know hes just a friend and hes gay and hes just from canada and he just needed a green card

yeah so i said ok relax please yknow i mean sex can be just about two people right there in the moment yknow its if he wants to see me again he can call and if not thats fine too so after a looooot of talking   i convinced him
ok all right we want to hear everything monica get the wine and unplug the phone rachel does this end well or do we need to get tissues
ok all right lets hear about the kiss was it like was it like a soft brush against your lips or was it like a you know a i gotta have you now kind of thing
