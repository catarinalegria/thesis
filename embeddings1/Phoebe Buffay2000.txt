Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Who's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Oh, I almost don't want to show this. Just remember I'm a minute younger.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people...
Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's...
They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther?
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure.
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
Oh down please. I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!
Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
I'm starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.
I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
Aw. I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I...I...
All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right?
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant--It's because I am.
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?
You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Your kid is seven?! He's really small. Please! Please get the tickets!
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I'm gonna take off.
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
"Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone." Dead on.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
Oh hey hi, he's doing it. He's breaking down the door. Okay, we're in.
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Hello handsome. Oh God. Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp right there.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
No they ran out of "It's a girl" but I can fix this one, See?
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay? That's just what she wants.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
I'D Better Go. Just Over Here I don't want to miss the fight.
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.
You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know Vicrum just called.
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Oh! Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go.
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!
I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
least you've been married, OH MY GOD! I wanna trade lives with Ross.
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! I'm kidding.
Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. Wach.
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy well what about ok well there's gotta be someone.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay...Mermen.
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Okay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off.
Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Are you asking me out? 'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. What?
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I won't.
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Yeah. . . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
There's your movie! Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.
Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
Gosh. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Y'know the only reason he's marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .
Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.
Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.
Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? Phoebe, Phoebe.
What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it"!
No... actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street... that's where stabby Joe works.
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Yeah, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other? It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God.
Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
"Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Ooh, what happened? Joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear: Oh.. My sister's raccoon.
Umm listen, I don't think...I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Yes, I...I am with child. And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.
Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before--Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm-Well since I was fourteen.
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
But I'm a professional! And I'm really good! Look, if you're uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Of course I do! And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So...
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
When she comes out, you hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just right out of her.
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
No, it's New York magazine. It's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
.and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can't wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's a trick."
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Really? There's nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
That's it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a break!" "No we weren't!" What happened to you two?!
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl.
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know... sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...
Thankfully you don't need me at all so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let's give it six to eight months .
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god what's wrong with me.
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Well, it's a long story. It's kind of embarrassing. Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you?
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."
Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I'm just gonna go. No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right!
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back . Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!
Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Oh...Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Okay, come on Rach it's present time! Y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together. It's kinda falling apart here.
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I'm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make... uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
That's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time.
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.
Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch.
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he's walking around thinking, 'Do I want to be a dad?' and then bam!
Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
It does! How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
Concert. Yeah. That does put us in...quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Yeah. Okay. Umm, y'know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you're marrying.
No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!
Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you're still pregnant. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y'know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips! Chandler: Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Yeah! It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade. Y'know with all the politics and mind games.
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me? When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.
I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.
I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn't go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony... I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer.
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time. "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Ole!
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
: It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! Classy, uh?
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said...
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"!
Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
You're thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of...See?
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy"
Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... Phoebe: Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange."
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
I had a great time. It was really top drawer. And Here's Something Rich thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
Umm... Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.
Hey. Ursula's fiance is really sweet! He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y'know normally y'know, I don't like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm...this...I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.
Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? 'Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... Hmmm... yummy Hmmm...
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Oh okay, it's P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in 'Ello there mate!
Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
Well it's only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y'know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have.
Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.
Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course.
Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a clue! He's just walking down the street thinking, 'I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!' then bam! He's a father and everything's different.
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not t-not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..." You know, it's every girl's dream!
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Okay. Umm look, you're coming on a little strong. But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don't we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability. Y'know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.
Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
she's a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to-what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice! May I try a pink one?
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just...
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have... have a great one!
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap.
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I'm gonna, I'm gonna want him back. So... I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!
Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward You kissed me.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh.
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now.
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. Now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No, don't sing along. Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!" Happy holidays, everybody!
Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... So... where does everyone summer?
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
