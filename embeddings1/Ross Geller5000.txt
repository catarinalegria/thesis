I'll make some calls.
Well, the lighting was okay.
I just grabbed a spoon.
No-o-o! No way!

Hello to the rest.
We'll give you Janice.
What's that on the bottom?

Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
My wife's a lesbian.
Okay. But not about this!
Actually, no, we're not.
So why don't you quit?
I did not freak out.
Is uh, is Monica here?
What? No-no, a lurker.
Wait a minute, look.
About four hours.
I think that would be best.
And we didn't have sex.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
What, it's not your fault.
Well, Ben would be there.
Yeah, of course, Donald.
So we're a little late.
What's the matter? You okay?
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
This is weird for me!
What are you doing here?!
I don't know, something girlie.
So uh, where's Monica?
Why did you hate me?
The Geller Cup.
The screaming guy?
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Technically, huh, no.
And that's funny, why?
Of course, what happened?
Also an island.
No. I'm saying it's now.
She's doing her laundry.
Women really want this?
Susan, go deep.
I will give you a call.
She may have died.
I'm gonna call after you!
Okay, that's, that's enough.
ON A CAT??!!!!
Monica. Whaddya think?

Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
Oh, okay. What-what about?
Hi. Where is everybody?
They have another guess.
I am gonna see her again.
Alright, shall we?
What? Your-your list?
I don't know if it's true.

Yeah. What-what should I do?
Stopped for a Chunky.
Well, can you blame her?
Well, not playing raquetball!
Awww, man! Really?
What the hell was that?!
That cup is mine!
No but, no but.
We were on a break!

No no no, go-
Hey, what's goin' on?
Aww, is it broken?
Oh my God, you guys!!
There's other stuff too.

What, the word hi?
That is what the thing is.
Okay. Sometimes I feel...
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
I can't catch a break!
She, she was different.
At the coffeehouse, right.
Excellent, that was excellent.
Okay, wish me luck.
She looks so small.

Geez! Are you ready?
It's an empty apartment.
Okay, break-up's still on!
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
Nobody likes change.

We already knew that!
Going out with who?
OK. I'm in my apartment...
Can I ask you somethin'?
All right, try pedaling.

Everything okay in there?
I can handle the stick!!
Wow, that's-that's-that's incredible.
Yeah! Se vice?
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
You're livin' the dream.

I can't believe that didn't work!
You've sentenced him?!
Hey, do you have any gum?
Hey! Are you ready yet?
Well then, what is it?!
OK. Hold my board.
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
Dude, what am I gonna...
You slept with my sister?
Uhh, those are tacos.
Can I see you for a second?
I can't believe this is happening.
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Long story, honey.
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
Sure, do whatever you want.
How could you not tell us?
No, 10 is the highest.
You're gonna be an aunt.
I don't think you have much choice.
You gotta hear this story.
Oh, where are you guys going?
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
She's not even here yet.
What? What's on your shoulder?
What're you talkin' about?
Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
Look I was going to tell you!
Then don't do that, alright?
How did you know about that?!
You're nose is bleeding!
I really wish that you wouldn't.
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Yes! We're getting married?!
Still thinking about it huh?
Can't do it, can you?
Really? That okay, that's great.
There we go. All better.
It hurts my teeth.
How'd the callback go?
I've been back and forth.
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
Oh.. oh... oh.
Actually, it wasn't that close.
He's taking her purse!
Let go! Let go!
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Green. To the green.
Great, how did it go?
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
And what is second prize?
Who the hell is Jordie?
I thought that was just a rumour.
Hey, you wet my pants!
Oh, that's great, that is great!
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Actually, it looks really good.
A basket of mini-muffins.
That's what you said last night.
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
How could you have told her?
Yes, and that's why we're here.
He does not look happy.
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
There was never a good time.
Yes, you can, very much.
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
Divorced men's club.
All right, here's the ring.
Again, it's not that he...
What's wrong with this year?
Some of your old stuff.
Why are you mad at me?
This place is really beautiful!
What are you, what are you doing?
hey, fella! How you doing?
And that's Phoebe over there!
It'll be okay Joe.
Why? Did you write it?
They published my paper.
Relax, I'll fix it.
Joey, some people don't like that.
I'm having a son. Um...
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
You're right, you're right, it is.
Unagi. I'm always aware.
Do not rush me!!
You wanna buy a car?
You have to respect the sea!
That's, that's nice twice!
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Oh. And how was the date?
Oh really! Why is that?
Look, I do not re-love her.
Although I was married to her.
Open it, open in.
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Hey, how are you holding up?
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
He finally asked you out?
Joey, get out of the fridge.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
I could, yeah, I can do that.
No, no, let me finish.
You need to get some sleep.
I'm in for fifty cents.
From you? Yes, please!
You've had feelings for me?
You don't have to shout everything.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
It's just a fur ball.
Are you guys sure about this?
No! No! That's-that's time-out!
So you two are really serious?!
Why aren't you guys dressed?
Ok, Mom never hit.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Thing, yes. Thing.
I will, I will find him.
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Here's your girlfriend's button.
Look at you! You're up!
All right. Okay, here we go!
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
So what do you want me to do?
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Wait! It was my plan.
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Oh my God, is that still...
Nono, that would be me again.
It tastes like feet!
You are way off, pal.
Ohh, these are pretty good.
Cannot feel my tounge.
You were trying to eat it!
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Nope, nope, that's it.
Rach, he's not an ex-con.
OK, now, sit. OK.
So you do know a little English.
Yeah-no, just that last song.
...will be two months...
What are you guys doing later?
Wh-what did he say?!
Okay. Um, how about these?
Um... uh.... vulva.
No touch! No touch!
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
All right. Feel good?
No! Do you wanna hear it?
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
Wow! Happy Monica's night!
Come on, show them to me.
Oh that is so great! That's...
I can't believe he didn't come!
I'm pretty sure that it is...
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Umm, your boxes are umm...
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Hey! It's starting to snow.
We're really gonna do this, huh?
Because, because I've got Ben.
No! I balanced my checkbook.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
That's right! Wait no, Ben.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
...since I stopped trying.
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
And why wouldn't he get it?
Thanks, man, big help.
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
I have an oily T-zone!
And that wasn't fun for you?
Man, I sure miss Julie.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
You are? Me, too!
She's dating. She's dating.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
Rach, I got a message from you.
What? A brain transplant?!
That's, that's funny. Change!
So where are we going next?
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
I think the check in is that way.
I'm never gonna find love again.
I love it, when we share.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Does it always, uh--?
Well, but, but. . .
Pass it! Pass it!
C'mon kid, let's go.
I think just the annulment for today.
Dr. Green. How are you?
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
That said it was my sandwich?!
Come on, they're gonna love you.
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Come on, you know they love you.
You had fantasies about Emily?
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Well, we should probably get going.
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Yes, of course they like you!
You called Animal Control?
Well, that's cool. So did...
Looks like a fun gang.
No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
I don't know what you're talking about.
So I nodded off a little.
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Everything? Even the TV?
....I have to go to China.
No, but, your-your mad.
Oh. And what do you call that?
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
No, I, I only know Lipson.
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Wh- are you welling up?
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
So that's two of my wives.
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Look, they must be stopped!
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Ah, which, which one?
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Slides are almost ready.
Wow, hello! You look great!
Whoa! You had sex today?
Hey, someone order a coat?
His daughter was hot.
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
73! 72! 71!
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
Uh.... bean! Bean!
Oh no! An asteroid!
Did you really hear a bear?
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
Where the hell have you been?
It's just I miss her so much.
Then what am I supposed to do?
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Why is it inside out?!
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
Is this what you had in mind?
How can you not believe in evolution?
But you already told me everything.
I guess it's worth a try.
Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
I think we proved our point.
Okay, can we just sign please?
Where exactly is your zoo?
With you?! Yeah right!
It's okay man, be strong.
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
You're good. These are not.
No. It's the one he's licking.
Oh, you have some studying to do?
OK, I need to lie down.
Do you know the word crapweasel?
Catch any big fish?
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Wha-, oh, quit it.
Over my dead body!
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Please tell me you're joking.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
What, uh... what were you thinking?
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
So, are you gonna see him again?
Why-why would I care about that?
What difference does that make?!
Try telling my wife that.
I'll get it! I will get that!
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
All right, I just wanted to check.
Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
And why exactly would I do that?
What are you doing here, Santa?
Just, just say what you feel.
They're not listening too me?
I know. I am, I am so sorry.
I-I had to show Chandler something?
That! Let's talk about that.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
She already lives in London.
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
Well...In-in case of emergency.
What?! Give-give me a brush.
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
Eh? We'll show him!
I have a bone to pick with you.
And the place looks so nice!
...How long was I in there?
I sort've already asked Chandler.
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
What, to blind my child?
Well? Isn't that amazing?
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
All right. All right, I'll do it.
And that's, that's funny why?
One more day, seriously/
Who's drink can I freshen?
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Ohh, yeah I already have one.
No, just give me another minute.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
I don't know. What's in this pie?
So I'm gonna take off then!
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Okay, it must just be me then.
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
You are, you're welling up.
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
Okay, you are totally making this up.
Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Ok, got the vent open.
So what's it shaped like?
What? Are you going back to work?
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
And now you want that money back.
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
Why do they keep doing that?
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
What?! Over a stupid room!
...But a man can change.
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Well did you try calling her?
Why? Why can't you go to him?
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
I was thinking more like a hundred.
What, that wasn't the great news?
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
That is one good looking man!
No, but it is frowned upon.
If only he were a woman.
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
This is not good for my rage.
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Hey, save us some pizza.
Then be supportive like a guy.
Ok, here, here. There we go.
It was, it was her voice.
Could you be less enthused?
Alright you kids, bye now.
Come on! Come on. Come on.
It uhh, it won't go back.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Wow, how many have you got?

Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Happy New Year, Pheebs!

Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
We'll be starting with apples.
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
It's still looks pretty far!
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Please. This is so your fault.
She seems really, really fun!
Look, you wanna get off my back?
Done! With time a-to-spare.
No thank you for... Thank you.
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
It's my new apothecary table!
And it works both ways.
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
You got me a cola drink?
That's all you're basing this on?
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
Well... not in the same way...
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Oh, it was, nah, well....
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Did I, did I even treat?
Do you say this stuff to girls?
All right, did you just say all right?
Okay. So we're, we're good?
What? That's like insanely easy!
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Yeah, no one talks like that!
I dunno, there's just something about...
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Please don't say naked chicks.
Well, he had gravity boots.
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
All right. I think it was a mouse.
And what are you going to do for him?
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Just, just, just pick one!
No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
Are you not seeing him anymore?
When did I say you were boring?!
I made fun of his accent.
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
And why do you care so much?
And you didn't marry him because...?
And that's not against your oath?!
Why are we in bed together?
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
No, women are welcome to play.
Events from around the globe.
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
It's alright, it's no big deal.
I want to take my tongue... and...
Do not give him any money!
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
I went to Egypt with my dad.
You have a line down your face.
Hi honey, how did it go?
Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
You really serve people sneezers?
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
No, no, don't. Why don't we?
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
Won't you dance around with me.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
What, uh... what juggling thing?
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
On account of my rage.
They make you take an oath?
And um...You look nice today.
Is it? Feels like two.
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Ohh, this cake is really good!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Because you sent away the dog!
Correct, his profession was?
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Well you need 60% to pass...
How much did you pay for that?
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
Let me see that! Oh man!
...and I really think it should be me.
With such a sad history.
We?! We angered it?!
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
And on your anniversary, for shame!
Why- why are you here, Carol?
What's wrong with being the Bings?
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Can't we just use a pen?
And I too am just a love machine.
Yeah, were better off without them.
The physical act of love.
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
You told her before you told us?
Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
That only took me an hour.
Was your basket on top?
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
My first time with Carol was...
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
Alright boys, let's eat.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Surely you can think of something good.
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
You want me to call her right now?
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
But-but, Liam's on my team.
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
She wants me to move to London.
Not for the next few minutes.
We uh, we just cooked it up.
I hope Ben has a little sister.
It's okay. Come, come on in.
...is for me not to see you anymore.
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
So umm, where are the other guys?
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
Rach, have you never done this before?
I could ask her to live with me!
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
So really, what'd ya have?
Hey listen man, about the stripper...
15? Your personal best!
Is that supposed to be an insult?
Well, why're you all dressed up?
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
Are you're hands still wet?
It's also a sign of friendship.
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Hi, did you order some bananas?
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
No. I am not putting on makeup.
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
You're kid's name is Raymond!
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
First of all, I'm not losing...
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Nothing I do means anything, really.
You got ink on your lip.
No, come on don't start. Ouch!
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
That little naked guy would be me.
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
2 hours, 27 minutes.
What's wrong with people having sex?
You complete me kitchen, matey!
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Was I talking to her about gas?
Hey does anyone have any gum?
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
So uh, have a great time down there.
She said you gave her the razor!
I can't believe no one believes me!
So uh, Emily called last night...
Real magic does exist.
Are you into crafts at all?
What's up with the greed Joe?
Who cares? I repel women.
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Can I, can I help you with something?
Man! They cannot get enough!
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Ohh! A man with a plan!
That sounds great. Same for me.
Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
Okay, I've got three of my five.
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Just uh, brought back your videos.
Stupid balls are in the way.
Get away from me I said no!
That guy, he burns me up.
I played bad on purpose guys.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Le Poo's still alive?!
Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning.
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
What? Great, now I'm having a baby.
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
That was 14 hours ago.
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
That is so good! Do it again!
Can I use.. either thumb?
Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Marcel! What've you done to him?
All right, bad ankle, got it!
It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go?
All right! I want my key back!
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
One, two, three, four!
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Then where the hell have you been?!
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!
He gave me a pill for it.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Number six: the way you smell.
You know the song! Sing along!
Not on you! On the stripper!
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
No? What happened, big guy?
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
There are naked ladies there too.
Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Because there are naked ladies there.
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Mon, look who I ran into!
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Do they wait for me to do this?
What you don't think I'd go up to her?
Let's also get a hot plate!
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
The head, the head. You gotta...
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
What the hell happened on that beach?!
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
No, she kept kicking me away!
Why does anyone have to be naked?
So we should probably get going soon.
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
All right, gentlemen, you're up first.
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
These-these are beads of joy.
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
Did you see me write one down?
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
So-so come! Why don't you come?
No-no, he's, he's very docile.
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Neil Sedaka wears them.
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
Hey, what you do on your own time...
What's ah, what's so funny about that?
This is the coolest house ever!!
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
We'd like to close our accounts.
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
All right, maybe it means that too...
Let me see! Show them!
Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
What'd you do, take him whaling?
I'm just trying to help you, move on.
You can see where he'd have trouble.
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
I know. My arm is killing me.
And he's, he's a total stranger?
All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
It's the off light. Right Ross?
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Well, John McLane had plans!
That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
So umm, any word from Susan?
We fell asleep! That is all.
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
Then you are neither of your parents!
Dude! How-how did you write this?
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
It's not like we don't know how to party!!
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
What? You have a date? Who with?
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
And somebody took a shot at me!
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
Yes but too me he's just, man.
Besides, there's a big age difference.
After one class? I don't think so.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
I'll take it. My gift to you man.
Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
Open up. We want to talk to you.
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
I need juice! People need juice!!
You hated me when we were kids?
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Hey, I've been married 3 times
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Thanks. What photo album was it?
A lot of other gas smells...
You can totally, totally live on this.
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
How come? Everybody else does.
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
They kept your room for a while.
Whip it out, whip it out.
Yes! My baby's finally free!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
I do have a newfound respect for life.
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Y'know, he hums when he pees!
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
If you wanna put a label on it.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
To wear in front of people?
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
W-What was the one right before bananas?
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Well that's the first time we've said that.
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
When, when were you... under me?
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
I see. So what do you propose to do?
No one got me an engagement present.
Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
Were you the ones called the cops?!
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Some days it's all I can think about.
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
That is an old, Chinese woman!
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
You know how close women can get.
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Home is Home Star stew.
Why, why, why would you dream that?
You can have the last piece, if you want.
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
The big book of childrens' names.
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
They don't look any bigger than me!
How come it's not mixing with the water?
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Well you sure used a large font.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Until we start to look very small.
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
So let's decide on the spending limit...
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
And here's little Ben nodding off...
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
How are you ever going to sell this place?
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
See, I would never snap at you like that.
That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
All right! You go get him! Let's go!
You know what I like most about him, though?
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
That commercial always makes me so sad.
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Well, these. These are yours right here.
The way he makes me feel about myself.
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
She lent me an egg once.
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
That must be our alcohol and beers!
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
We have got to start locking that door!
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Come on. All right, here we go. All right?
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
Better not be doin' these in order.
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
I think it means he freaked out and left!
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
It does. It really and truly does.
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Well y'know 'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
After what I did? Can you blame her?
What's going on?! That's what's going on!!
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
What do you like better flora or fauna?
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
There was no song. There was no song!
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
Who needs a lease when it's family!
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Of course she would, you're a college man.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
People are doing it in front of my book!
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Then you should have said something before I met her.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
It took two people to break up this relationship!!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Shh! Of course, why don't we go inside?
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
Getting it away from me would be job one.
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Well, technically it seven billion years ago...
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh...
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Come on, would you grow up? It's no big deal.
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here.
Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan...
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. You're welcome.
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda...
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
You-you're gonna get married?! I mean... We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so...
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! .
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny...
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well....
Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch.
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Uh, just a sec dad. OK, be cool, just be cool. OK dad.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
11, unbelievable 11 is correct. All right, that's 4 for the guys. Ladies, you're up.
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. The Lightning Round!
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then...
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or...
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so...
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
