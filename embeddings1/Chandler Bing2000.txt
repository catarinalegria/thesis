Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
