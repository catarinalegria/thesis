I don't like your massages.
You see what I mean.
Oh, so you're divorced?
Oh that's too bad.
Okay, that hurt us.
Me?! Why me?
That's totally understandable.
Well, that can't be good!
You have gotta stop!

So what'd you do?
Come on, tell me.
You want some help.
Okay. It's a racecar.
Ross, don't. Ross!
We don't, really.
What is going on here?
We still have porn.

What are you going to do?
Well, I did not know that.
Jeez, what a baby.
Yes! Well that-yes.
Isn't this amazing?
How do ya do.
The one that doesn't.
You are going downer!
Wow, this is weird.
They don't have those.
That's okay, we understand.
I bet he can.
Aww, thanks man.
So, what do you think?
Alright, let's do this.
Monica and I are engaged.
Can I be that guy?
Let's go quicker.
Wish me luck.
Will you marry me?
Well, I guess that's something.
Hey! Happy birthday.

What is it doing here?
Bye! Thank God
That's right! I'm not!

We're worried about you.
I respectfully disagree.

No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Really? Are you sure?
Could I borrow it?
You have done enough!
What? May I?
Why am I looking?
Are we in London?

We are bad people.
What's wrong with you?
Do I look fat?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Check out the ring.
You said no right?!
No problem roomie.
Yes, yes eight.
You don't trust him?
Whoa, she's pretty.

Yeah, you're right about that.
So how'd it go?
We actually missed it.
Okay, fine, $300.
One more game?
Oh yeah? That's great!
You wanna share it?
I sent them home.
Hey, that was really good!
Because we hate them.
Monica's a little drunk.
Oh, they're a hoot.
That's what you should say.
Emma was doing it!
No. No! No! No!
That's what Monica said.
You okay over there?
No I-I-I'm fine.
So what are you gonna do?
That's still in there?!
Hi, how are ya?

This is not a sign!
It's Clint! Clint!
Relax your hand!
Fine, let's do it.
Ross, ten o'clock.
How drunk are you?
Like an eclipse.
Then don't leave me!
But we should take it.
Why?! What happened?!
That's me! Come on!
I can't believe you did this.
What a sweet story.
What's the matter Joe?
What, what, what?!
Oh sweet Moses.

Hey! How was lunch?
You mind if I...

No, there were two.
Oh, the mixed tape.
Not fun anymore?
Hey! How'd it go?
Oh, good job Joe.
All yours babe.
I'm begging you stop.
I think these are yours.
Why can't you tell her?
Yeah, like in a cab...
Oopsey, missed it!
Plus, you look cool.
Hey! Ready to go?
I thought it was $98.50.
First of the month.
Robert's coming out.
Why is that so funny?

How do you figure that?
Oh my God! Play!
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Yep, pretty much.
So I got ya something.
Yeah, I'll sit down.
Hello, Chandler Bing.
All right I'll have one.
Honestly? Me too.
You don't like that show?

Oh, this is not that bad.
So, what are you gonna do?
A face ass?
Oh, DAMN IT!
Oh, my, god!
Dude, you're shaking!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Bored and bored!
Humiliating and noble!
Y'know what, pretty good.
Well, we are great guys.
Could I be more sorry.
There's a Mr. Bing!
Yeah so, Tuesday?
That's the perfect amount!
That's a low one!
Welcome home man.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
I've got good news!
In the game room!
Picturing that tree?
That's... That's was...
Couldn't be more out.
Hey, he's not crying.
Well, aren't you a treat.
No, Amish boy.
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Wow! You look amazing!
Okay. I'll be right there.
Well, what did she say?
Okay, that's enough honey!
It still doesn't work.
That would be advice!!
Stop it. Stop it!
I'll ask. Boohaki?
Okay, anything for you sir?
He will, Joe.
So, this isn't over?
'S'why I'm dancing...
Stop making candy!
Hey, man. What's up?
We can't accept this.
Really? You're gonna be okay?
What does it say?!
Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Totally worth it!
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
We can talk about that.
Good morning, everybody.
Oh fresh air!
I'll tell you at the wedding.
I'm not supposed to tell you.
You okay there man?
H-He's in China!
I'm free! I'm free!
Well, I can't do it either.
I can't believe she's married.
Haha, no thanks!
Aww, I love you so...
That sounds like fun.
He has a gun!
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Its Phoebe! Hi!
That's-that's my nubbin.
You know, you think I would.
No thanks, Josephine.
No thanks, Mom!
I wanna quit the gym.
Ah. Chandler Bing.
Yeah! You wanna come?
That's what I was doing too.
Alright, here's ten.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
I made that joke up.
You do? That's fantastic!
What-what Richard thing?
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
Is that a real thing?
No you know I don't mind.
She's not gonna say no.
What about the time difference?
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
I don't think you can do that!
I mean, I was sitting there.
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
So, where's Mike?
See? Here we go.
I think I should get the chair!
Have you seen Joey?
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Oh, okay. Here you go.
...The second guy.
That was... Impressive.
Oh, I don't know, a million?
I'm not Jewish, so...
Well it's very unsettling.
But, those are for you.
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
You didn't just break up.
You gotta do it, man.
Thank you! Thank you!
And you're okay with that?
Nice work my friend.
Right. So, I'm sorry...
Okay, I gotta go to work.
What gave me away?
Well, this is much better.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
We're moving to Tulsa!
Um, is it sugarless?
In a bad way?
Rachel lost Marcel.
We have heard you play.
Another hard 8.
Courtside? Oh my God.
And twenty-five it is.
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Well, thank you for lunch.
This is not going to work.
Okay, then get the lobster!
Well this is just sad!
I'm over here big guy.
Oh, what the hell is that?
How far outside?
Where you going, Joe?
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Hi Joey's sisters!
Are you really that busy?
Hey-hey are you drunk?
On every word?
Yeah, let's just forget it.
Yes. Right where?
It's a sock bunny.
Is it really that bad?
You still want that baby?
For three years?
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Well this one's for you.
So, what're you gonna do?
Hi! How'd it go?
Why would I be mad?
She's one of us now.
It happened in London.
Hey, this is so unfair!
I spelled out boobies.
Ah that's a cantelope.
That was pretty 007.
Your cappucino sir.
And to you too, Helen.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
Yeah, check out the ring.
Well yeah, but then...
And your friend Phoebe?
So it did go well.
Oh, do you not want to?
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
What am I gonna do now?
Hi, Paul, is it?
Jumping on the bed?
Wait, we can't do this.
All right, bye-bye now!
Coffee in a fight!
Oh yeah man. Joey.
This is what I want to do.
So, you busy Thursday?
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
She? It's a girl?
Joey, no means no!
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
I'm not arguing with that.
And a date with a man!
He saw a therapist?
You mean like, music?
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Why did I get married?!
All right. Very good.
Um-mm, yeah right!
Oh, seriously you want him?
Ooh! That's my girl!
Can we start over?
This vacation sucks!!
Hey! How's the boat?!
Lose the other guys.
I will explain it to her.
Mine was a humdinger.
What equity investments?
Forget it, that's off.
Did I not mention that?
Yes, but for the last time.
We're taking a break!
Yeah, Ross is here so...
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
Hey, I've been honing!
Because that would be crazy?
Do you know what just happened?
Did you know this about him?
All right, let me in.
Happy New Year!
Who are those people?
So what does this mean?
Yeah, he came up...
Seriously, answer faster!
Joey's a sex addict.
Hi, oh hi.
Not it! Damn it!
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Ohh, that's a good one.
Ahh, third base.
I know, what are we gonna do?
So what are you going to do?
When'd you meet her?
I also said, "Yes!"
That's patio furniture!
Today is the sixth.
What is the matter with you?
I can't believe you came back.
I can check that for ya.
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Of course it was!
Phoebe knows about us!
Nope, not under here!
Because it's too delicious.
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
Oh, great. This is just...
Your sister Ursula.
Come on guys, PUSH!
Totally crazy stupid.
See you later Mon.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Unfortunately that is correct.
OK, let's do it. What?
Oh no, no, no, no.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Stick to your side!
Okay, what do you guys think?
You are really frightening me.
Does anybody know me?!
What's the matter honey?
What's up with the simian?
Rachel, wait, wait.
Okay, one thing at a time.
Ooh, you almost had it.
I'm sorry, I won't be here.
He really is a chameleon.
Do you want me to call?
PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Oh yeah, that looks good.
Me? No. You?
Uhh. You are welcome.
Okay, so he's out of here.
Well, I feel like a snack!
I'm going to the bathroom now.
How do you feel about that?
We already knew that!
The comedian? USO?!
You're welcome, sweetheart.
What is wrong with Emma?
'Cause I was sitting there.
What happened? What happened?!
Okay, good luck with that.
I can't believe I ruined this.
That is a bad interview.
Oh, okay, time's up!
How could it not matter?!
This can not be happening!
So are we...friends again?
I don't know, I'm very tired.
Actually, I don't like martinis.
All right, rock on.
Staying out of the way.
And last but not least.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
I'm a pretty little girl.
It's me. I'm the other guy.
An old cookie?
Let's have Monica decide.
They'll never understand!
Look, maybe we should go?
It's an old key!
It doesn't scare me!
Let me try it on!
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
What are you doing out there?
Bullies, big bullies.
Did she freak out?
Oh, you'll see my friend.
Oh uh, o, OK.
Yes, it's also 2003.
So, uh, how was he?
Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Work on your music?
We could trade later.
Hey, you feelin' better?
Hey. Where've you been?
We're very happy for you.
I see where you're goin'!
I don't... uh... understand.
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
How long was I in there?
I wanna quit the bank!
Do we pay for this?
Cool, girl roommate.
Whoa! Don't know about that.
Do you have any ideas?
Hey, you must be Owen.
I'll cancel the sodas.
Hello! Little ones.
So- you can tell?
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
So, are we going in there?
I'm so sorry you're sick.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
It's throwing and catching!
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Now that Rachel's gone?
You wanna hug it out?
Well where did she go?
Y'know I think you can take her.
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Lick away my man.
Am I naked again?!
God that is good TV.
Can I just say one thing?
Batman has the Batmobile!
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
He took my essence!
I think you should take the job.
So what was it for anyway?
Alright, so what's it about?
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
No, no, no. No-no-no.
So, I guess this is over.
With extra pulp?
Woah, hey, yo.
Can I use your phone?
I think it just fell off.
Your tax dollars?
You slept with the stripper?
Oh, this is soo bad.
Well, Joey's my best friend.
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
He's the boss's son.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Which smells delicious!
Yeah, well, lucky for you.
Always illegal Joe.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Hey man, what's up?
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
I can't smell your sandwich?
All right! Let's do it!
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
My lighter's in there!
Wait, wait, wait.
What did I marry into?
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
You have to really wanna see it.
They put you in jail?
I can't believe we're doing this.
It's the Miracle Wax.
The British are coming?
Well, either that or uh...
Aah, y'killing me!
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
I can't remember which sister.
And that doesn't scare you?
Oh you knew that. Good!
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
You know...Oh My God.
There's nobody here Joe.
Don't read my condoms!
Let them win one.
Did I go to this school?
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
No, no, no, no, no!
OK, Pheebs, your turn.
Football? Just football?
Not 700 exactly?
Oh, are we playing this?!
I'll give up my ticket.
I - I don't think I can.
Because, I'm too afraid.
Okay, come here! Come here.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Why? What happened to him?
Let me see the earrings.
Hmmm, that's very cool.
What, what's what you mean?
He's Greek Orthodox.
So that's the girl you like.
It's not charity, Joe...
You mean a three pointer?
It's okay, I got a plan.
But we don't know the neighbors.
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
No, no, you don't have to see.
That's not a state Joe.
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
I got you something from Vermont!
I did! I absolutely did!
So, a professor, uh?
Could you want her more?
You just thought of that in there?
What is so funny about that?
I said art lover.
Do I still call you Ross?
I can't believe we live here!
Oh no! No! No! No!
Excellent hole, Joe.
He's at a dinner party.
What are you guys talking about?
No, really you're gonna freeze.
So--You got in voluntarily?!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
I don't know. What do you think?
Okay, on three. One....Two....

A little late for that.
What?! What-what is it?!
Hey, what you guys talking about?
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
Tell it again. Seriously.
No, I ah, I didn't do them.
Now, there's two reasons.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.

You don't even have a car!
Well, we could count again.
Oh yeah! With who?
Yeah, let's celebrate life!
And that's how you bought it?
You, you are gonna love this.
Happy birthday, pal!

Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Not if I kiss you first.
Hey! Happy birthday ...
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Ok, this could be tough.
Boys? We're going in.
Somebody is gonna pick us.
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
You burn your mouth?
Phoebe is, making people.
Sounds like a date to me.
Oh, what a crappy night!
No, not us... Us!
Should we call the spitter?
This took you all day?!
Uh, if you say so sir.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
She has a real name.
I'll catch you guys later.
I don't care! I don't care!!
I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
What am I gonna do, huh?
Well the duck can swim.
Put Joey on the phone.
Oh o-, OK man.
Merry Christmas, you guys!
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
What? What do you mean you know?
I am, I'm ignoring you.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
Could've been a peach.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Phoebs, play with meeee.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Isn't Ben in this?
How's your room Rach?
And the bunny got away.
Man, I am so beat.
Your boyfriend is so cool.
But you're still my friend?
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Borrow money from me?
I never stopped loving you.
Okay, who wore those?
Ok, you can not do this to me.
Oh, how well you know me...
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
I'm not getting into this again!
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
How do you know that? How?
...And what did you bring?
But I think we should tell her.
Ring dammit, ring!
Takin' that with you, huh?
You're shooting with Althea?!
It's exactly like it sounds.
So who's gonna tell them?
This is going in your book?
Don't play with his things.
Ok, how about this ?
I believe I read that somewhere!
The reason he just said.
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Her name is Erica.
To pay for the gym.
I don't have travel insurance.
What did you guys just do?!
How can you be so confident?
No. No. I don't think so.
Oh! It's on! It's on!
I can't believe it! We're here!
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Fine! Maybe I will too!
The man's got a point.
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
OH MY GOD!!!
That, that's what's stupid.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Well maybe he was nervous.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
So uh, what are you in for?
Take off your shirt!
I want you to say that you like her!
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Man, I gotta get a kid.
Is that your new walk?
I said it first, bro.
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
I never want to leave you again!
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
What about that circled one?
That's what they'll call us.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Oh, right, right, shut up.
What stupid thing did you do?
Hi honey I'm home!
Your hands are shaking.
Sounds like a fun party.
Beam me up Jesus.
He thought you said gonad.
I mean, you have a lovely home.
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
That was there when I got here.
It's like a giant hug.
You can't move at all?
She's just doing her job!
And, a lemon lime.
Okay, we owe you a present.
There we go little fella.
Those are all really old!
Can I finish my story?!
Hey Joe what's up?
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
What-what 'cha doin'?
Did she go out with him?
No not Candy Lady.
Can you people not see me?!
What if Joey were president?
Way to be cool, man.
That's not specific to girls.
I paid for those tickets!
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
Dude that is so sad.
So are you gonna...talk to her?
We've got to do something!
I said, "Like what?"
Why haven't you told them?!
Oh, good. Rog is here.
You have to pick your moments.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
By drowning or...?!
Yes have you seen any?
Oh, the tears are real.
Is there a puppy here?
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
Well, how you died was funny.
So, is Janine around?
Well that's a full cup!
It was a car backfire!
You are so great! I love you!
You can't make this stuff up!
Pretty good! I told her.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Oh they didn't want to come!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Did you not understand the story?
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
Is anybody else scared?
Oh, we could do this all day.
Your liking it, huh?
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
No, no, this is the first time.
What are you guys doing together?
Pie eating contest?
You're naked in this picture!
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Have fun at church-camp!
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Ah, finally an explanation.
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
You mean the lully story?
Oh, that was my work laugh.
What about the obsessive cleaning?
I thought your time ran out.
This, this actually is a...
God, I love these fingers...
I got it! Scotch... tape.
Althea?! What are you doing?!
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Oh, so that's what this is for.
She said she'd call me.
Who the hell is Carl?!
So, we gettin' a fish?
Well you proved them wrong.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Man, she is really gullible.
I'm afraid I might just be.
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
And was the curse lifted?
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
All right, I'll pick that one.
Sorry about the table, man.
But, I never left the room!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
It is so good to see you!
You're definitely scaring here.
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Oh come on you big faker!
Who are you going out with?
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
You gonna buy a new one?
Well, like father, like son.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Die Hard still great!
Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
So ah, whatcha watching?
Hey! How'd the audition go?
We are gonna be great parents.
No-ot for me it doesn't.
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Hello sir, you know Monica.
Okay, look, just do it gently.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Hey, big guy, game time.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
You can't just call Monica's room.
No, that was Dana Caplin.
They're still just friends, right?
Well, I, I should go in there.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Uh, could you leave me one?
So whaddya got there Monica?
Joey, wait! The ball!
Okay, here is the phone bill.
Not once did we do that.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
GET OUT NOW!!
No, did he hug you?!
So excited about your letter!
What've you been up to?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
I always liked you, Ken.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Yes that was a nice place!
Oh, is that against the rules?
Stay out of my freezer!
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
I'm not breaking up with her!
You're a little high maintenance.
Whoa, snowing out there?
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
What the hell is going on?!
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
I've got canned goods.
The wife says "Hi!".
You hear that? We're the guys.
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
So you're really okay with this?
I'm sure you're right, but why?
And no kissing your neck.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
You know that's not the reason Joe.
Me! On my computer.
Where's my seat belt?
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
You're turning into a women.
I didn't know Monica had these!
Game's tomorrow night Joe.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
How was your date with Joey?
There you go! There you are!
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Really? Like you have a routine?
What are you guys doing out here?
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Uh, yes, yes it is.
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Well, those were seals, man.
Two hours, that lasted!
Right. So how're you doing?
No! No! Not, Paris.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
But honey you don't have to.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
WHAT IS IT?!
Glass, sand, whatever.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Well, so why not go knock?
Doctor Connelly just called.
It was a "Wendy's!! "
I can't believe the guys missed this.
Ooh! Calm down ...
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
Here we go, here we go.
Well, what did the police say?
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
What... did you get me there?
Love your condoms my man.
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Seriously, where did this happen?
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
And this- is my reward!
She was not good. Not good.
You're not gonna need my help?
He started mine first!
Hmm, the game's at one.
Why are you wearing my apron?
So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
I'm gonna put on some music.
They're never coming down now.
Can I sleep on your couch?
And then Joey remembered something.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
Our guy smells incredible.
You said that to me last week.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Why is your family Ross?!
Well then why can't I see it?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
You know, I think I might just.
I know, but just let me say it.
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
But then later that night...
Ooh, let me talk to him!
That is the exact same thing.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
Oh my God, introduce us!
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
We're teeth people Zack!
Wow! Look at them run.
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
There are seven?! That's one?
Well, only if you order stuff.
Could there be more Kims?
I know! You ready to trade?
I'm not even... I'm not even...
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
Youre not gonna lose him.
Huh! Where is the dog?!
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Kori? Kori Weston?
Mm! Night Gar'!
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
I didn't know you had another level.
When did that happen to you?!
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Okay, let's find these birds.
I thought I had to make the jokes!
Janice is gonna go away now.
Hello! One marriage please!
I don't know... um, Grease?
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Op, op, I'm convinced!
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
We don't need to remedy that.
That was pretty intense huh?
oh yes, God yes!!
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
But are you sure you can do this?
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Bye. Are you still out there?
Kinda. They're really big.
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
I do NOT want this unit!!
No freakshow, she's fictional.
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Paid your phone bill?
I was not ready for this today!
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
That new mountain bike?
What is the matter with you ?!?
I know. He has your eyes.
Quick! What time is it?!
mmm That's enough about you!
The one time they're not home.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
As crazy as soccer?
Stop talkin' to your men.
Might wanna try Joseph.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Why am I hearing cheering?
What!? Of course I did!
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
We're not gonna lose to girls.
You left a shoe here?!
...and then it got canceled.
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
What?! Why does she think that?
Can I give you a present now?
I did pay for half of it.
Joey, I saw you push him!
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Joey was in a porno movie.
Well then maybe you should take it.
Hey, you said that without gagging!
Do you have my credit card?
Well it's not Sean Penn.
Ha! I'm just messing with you.
And the Knicks rule all.
You did look like an idiot.
They got a breakfast buffet.
: I thought we had them!
I'd love it if you would do it.
But I love swing music!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
You totally screwed him over.
I quit and you learn what I do?
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
All right buddy, way to go!
Oh, well... Maybe we could...
I got the time to get to know Julie.
Wow, he looks so normal.
So you didn't mean any of that?!
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Well, she... she didn't win...
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Ross' shirt is torn.
Your work makes me sad.
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
No. How are ya Paul?
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
There's no back to this couch!
Well, it still has to go, right?
How about those three pointers?
Really? What changed your mind?
See, I told you they don't swim.
No, we only went out once.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
No! No! No! I can't do that!
There's a hair in my coffee.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
So what job did you get Joe?
How did the job stuff go?
Lets not do that any more.
God!! What am I gonna do?!
All right, call it in the air.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Okay, let's play my game now.
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
And I just want a million dollars!
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
You mean you didn't get it from this?
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Yeah! All right! You go first.
All right, maybe I should call her.
And I think Ross is generous too.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
They're in my bag over there.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
How did you? How? How?
Ah! The high road...
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
That's what our friends call us.
Our next cocktail party?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
No! We're not borrowing money.
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Please tell me you got the message!
You know how to use a compass?
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Kill me. Kill me now.
Your last roommate's kidney?
Who said anything about Christmas?
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
Guys guys, check this out.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
What we did last night was....
So uhh, how's the palace?
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
My friend's name is Joey.
Well, did-did you correct him?
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Man, didn't she like just get here?
I don't know. Should we try it?
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Wow umm, calm down.
There you go! Someone came!
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Do either of you have the keys?
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
The man is showing brain.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Man, that's some bad advice!
I know. Gooooood luck with it.
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Can you ever feel your ears?
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
That's great. Can I see the book?
I didn't know it was a big secret.
Here we go! Here we go!
You kissed her that night too?
Too bad, she's leaving.
So you really OK about all this?
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
...Take off their hats!
Our guy has great hair.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Step away from the duck.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
More so than anything else.
There's a forest right outside.
Why don't you open with a joke?
Yes, every single one of them.
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
I'm a little busy here Paul.
Still on Amelia Earhart?
What in God's name is that?!
What do we use to split it?
But, we'll stay here with you.
No, no he went for a walk.
How is that ever going to happen?!
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
No one was around to hear that?
So uh, which one is mine?
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Now you do that, you're on TV.
Are those my wife's nipples?
Where are Bill and Colleen?
What do we do? What do we do?
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Just a little bit of sugar.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Hey, what did your agent say?
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
I have *not* thought this through!
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
How long have we been home?
Really? Right across the street?
He's taking off her coat!
Well you did pull his hair.
Rach, Rach, knock knock.
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Fears and Pet Peeves.
Wherever! I've got like 20!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Hit yourself in the tooth?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
How do you know so much about this?
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
We're notwe're not saying anything.
I know, I still am one of these.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
You wanna see if we still have it?
I think we've found our sperm!
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
You want me to wear your panties?
Here it is! Here it is!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Because the kids need new shoes.
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
You, touching yourself, out!
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
You do realise that's your brother?
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
So where are you applying to?
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Well it's not flexed right now!
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
It's like this, me, no jokes.
That really was an incredible wedding.
Right behind you, big guy!
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
does what always have to be sharks.
I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
We have to get out of here, baby!
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Look out kids, he's coming!
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Do we have to make the entire thing?
For an emergency just like this.
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Have you ever been with a woman?
Did somebody sign your bra?
...little playthings with yarn?
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Weird world. Your kids?
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
You are a frightening, frightening man.
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Yeah let's head off to work.
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Joey, why is your cable out?
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
No! No! No! I was so careful!
Would you please get some rest!
The food there was, was great.
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Your family name is Tribbiani.
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
Soo... you girls having fun?
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
We don't have to come up with this now.
What am I supposed to do with these?
I hope she throws up on you.
You still can't stand her can you?
No... It's all glued together.
This is the New York Times.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Yes, include more people in this.
That's easy, baggage claim.
No, we'd just like to close them.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
And now you're giving me the message!
We have free porn here!!!
That was like 5 years ago.
I found a dried up seashores.
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
Last time I do that, I promise.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
And condoms are the way to do that?
Not even on page 7?
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
I was not and oh God, shh!
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
You really think that is what he meant?
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Something else I might have said?
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
Alright I feel youger already!
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
No, come on, you know that's not true.
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Basically we just feel that he's...
Did that movie ever get made?
Well I like both eggs equally.
You can't leave me alone with her.
You're building a post office?
He just said, "No strippers."
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
They got a phone in there, right?
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
See now it feels like Christmas!
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
But we're not ready to tell yet!
When did I try to give you money?
I used to have that bumper sticker.
And that's... how... it's done!
Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Hello? Is someone on the line?
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
You look beautiful. Is this new?
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
More coffee over here, please!
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
You mean like for award shows?
Yes because uh, you look so young.
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
I could fall asleep at a play.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Was that Emma? Is she up?
All right, I'm nine years old.
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Are you actually saying these words?
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
And there's not chance that will work?
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
And now I've picked it up again.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Where did you hear it from before?
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Oh so there can't be any yelling.
It means we're holding hands.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
In a foreign, romantic country...
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Look, we can't stay in here forever.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Next time, can I say breathe?
I got something for her. It's a book!
Was that place... The Sun?
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
That's very funny. We done now?
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
All right! I found one that fits!
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
OK, so now we draw cards.
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
OK, this one right here is from me.
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Your sister Joan is crazy.
We were playing poker, alright...
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
You do know that Wham broke up?
All right! Bring it on, you...
Feelings, such strong feelings.
No, I just had to get a picture of this.
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Yah, I think I broke my hip.
You're it! Now run and hide!
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
How do you not fall down more?
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
You think we're ready for something like that?
No, the little girl creeps me out.
Kick save and... denied.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
One of the slots got filled.
Batman has a utility belt!
What, what are you laughing at?
Work people? Nobody told me.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
And lots of kissing your neck.
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Yes that would have made more sense.
Well that would help the pride thing.
Did you tell her what we talked about?
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
What did you do when they found out?
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
And protected them from a tornado?
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
What about things that are already gold?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Not to mention the cold sores.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Where are they? Where are they?
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Are you hugging the door right now.
Love what you've done with the place.
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
First I was afraid, I was petrified.
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Hold on! There is something different.
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Ya know, the man's got a point.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
We are switching back, right now!
Come on, let me see that smile.
Could we be more white trash?
Alright, now try taking a puff.
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
So we both finished our vows.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
So, uh, how often can you do it?
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Well where... Where did she go?
I can see why that's hard to resist.
There's another carton right over there.
They said it could be up to a year.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
let ME be a part of this!
Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
The key's stuck in the lock.
You guys ready fore the movies?
You built a fort didn't ya?
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
We have to assign heads to something.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
What are the odds? What are the odds?
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
We really need to take those tests?
So you know this leaves us with...
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
So I really never get to win anymore?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
What's the second part of your plan?
Had the money in the wrong hand.
And Milton Berle has a...
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
You mean there's more than one of us.
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
But if we win, we get your apartment.
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Ross came in forth and cried!
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
More importantly, was I any good?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Oh great, food with hair on it.
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
I told you I should not wear this color.
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Why to save your dignity my man.
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
Awesome, the name really stands out.
Oh. You mind if I join you?
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
There is not one hair on that head.
Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
I would really love it if could do both.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
That's where people make number two!!
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
You're not even giving them a chance!
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Some of these look a little frayed.
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
If you win, we give up the birds.
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
We are. He's meeting us here.
Depends on what you mean by we.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
What's an identical hand twin?
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Could you get us a couple of beers?
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
YOU NEVER DID IT!
Air hole! Air hole!!
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Really? In front of all this people?
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Relax! We just get her some antacids.
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Why would the baby creep me out?
Alright! Just follow my lead!
I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
So they're going on dates? When?
I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
Hell is filled with people like you.
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Dying people say the craziest things.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
Are you trying to do a British accent?
You tricked me to get me into bed?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
That's what you say at the end of a date.
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
See, that's why we don't let her play.
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Well, this is just as boring in England.
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
I was in the car with Nancy all day.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Monica and I almost got married last night.
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
He's really picky about his patients.
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
We should always always break up together.
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Don't judge me, I'm only human!
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
We don't know what could make this go away.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
He took my joke, he took it.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Is this a service you're providing me?
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
You gotta let me slam the door!
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
I wish I had smoked for my career...
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
I think we may have really done it this time.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
And is this in case the house sneezes?
Guess who's back in show business.
I am proud of all my friends today.
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Joey said that you're in here with another man.
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
That guy's going home with a note!
Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
David, I'm pretending to read here!!
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
The young hot ball and chain.
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Do you really find this attractive on him?
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Which technically now you should give back!
It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
And you're our age. You're our age.
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Those were like the best seats ever.
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
I know, I hate being left out of things.
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
You can be the best man when I get married.
It is starting to get dark out there.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Oh dear God, there's two of them!
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Of course I will call you. I love you.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
You put your fist through the wall?
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
Who jumps at loud noises!
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me.
It's not a real game! I made it up!
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Give him money? It was a joke!
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
You got waaaay too much free time.
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
And that's the only colour that comes in.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
No, no! We made this decision together.
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
...And then he burst into flames.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
You may wanna get some more of those too.
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
To the left, to the left- aww!
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
They have that on the napkins at the club.
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Or facing a bitch of a commute.
All right. Well, I'll check the guest room.
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Ok. First of all, this is green!
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
If it helps, I could slide over.
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
We are NOT signing those papers.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
OK. Brake left, gas right?
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
And I also got... two more apples.
Here, pass these, will ya..
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
So, how many have you sold so far?
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Well, at least we got these little guys out.
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
All right, let's show them how it's done.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
Again I must go back to, how?
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
At least as long as I have the pants.
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Actually, we already found a house we love.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
You told us both we could be in the wedding?
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Then free as a bird. What's up?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Course there, they just call it food.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Totally. I had sex in High school...
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
... And where's this money coming from?
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
To be fair this one does have nuts.
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Open up! Open up! Open up!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
The cold weather hurts my hip!
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
People who've never ever been to Paris.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
How much did I love The King and I?
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Do you realize you get louder each week?
So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
But you already gave all your money to charity!
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
: What do you need, what do you need?
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
The floating heads do make a good point.
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
It kills over one americans every year.
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
We came over as soon as we saw.
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
But those are the words! Those exact words!
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Please let me stay on this side of the door.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!
You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
Oooh that may be a New World's record
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Ok honey. that was close. -Cut to Rachel.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
As we all are at some point during the day.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
Was his question what's more boring than him?
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what.
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date...
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! I can't, I can't hear you.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Hang on, she's right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing.
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...
Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?
Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE.
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Then, I might as well ... do this . Not really sure what to do now.
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go to your room! You're grounded"?
If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it.
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? OPENING SEQUENCE.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed.
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Ok, go quick! Ross: Thank you for a delightful stay. Ross: Oh, my maple candy!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.
Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" "Oh, thank you very much!" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car.
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.
I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...
This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!
He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It'll probably be more than a year.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
It's a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying.
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job.
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Oh, because we love kids. Love 'em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine." So you just touch yourself for anything?
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his "business" partners.
Maybe we finish this for him! "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym who am I kidding pay-per-view porn. -Cuts to Monica.
Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, Here's The Thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.

Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
