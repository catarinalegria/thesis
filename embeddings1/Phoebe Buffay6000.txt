You have a third nipple?
I'm just helping the kids!
Ohh, that's too bad!
Umm, where's my purse?

Oh, they love your casserole.
What make you think I can?!

I don't know. Me neither.
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
No, not the used wax.
Oh, nobody's judging you.

Hey, did she buy it?
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
What are we going to do?!
Our apartment is ready.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Really? I've heard better.
You have your birth certificate?
'Cause that's just your taste.
You guys are here! Yay!
A chin dimple!
I thought you meant in life.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Ugh, I hate this year!
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
Oh yeah, so you know D?
You guys. You suck too.
What the hell are you doing?!
Oh, we killed them all.
I am extremely talented!
I am shocked! Shocked!!
She seems fine now.
Yes. Not out loud.
Your mom was arrested?
Yeah, me, too, technically.
Hummus. I got the hummus.
Big Bird's friend.
Monica, leave him alone!
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
We're practically kissing.
Because you're marrying him!
Jason is not a sissy!
Look, look, I have elbows!
Oh Willie's still alive!
Why are you being weird?
Hi Rob Dohnen.
Uh-Huh, Which is...?
OK Joey, your bet.
Maybe there's someone else.
I, umm, shut up!
I'm having my first contraction!
I know, the babies are asleep.
Oh my God! Is that him?
Okay. Well there's one down.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
I was in charge of cups.
I think it's important that you do.
Ohh, yes it would.
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
A little bit, yeah.
I-I-I found it interesting.
That is so sweet, you guys.
Hi! Wish me luck!
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
We were out of Doritos.
You'll have a last kiss.
No! Coins hate me!
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
You wanna do it right now?
Yes! .... or no.
I'm having a really good time!
Great! Thank you very much.
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Oh, oh! It's on again!
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
You didn't tell her did you?
Why? Why would you do that?
No! Barry and Mindy.
Yeah, this has happened before.
Ohh, uh-huh so much!
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
No, I think you should tell them.
They're gonna call her Chandler.
Definitely not his mother.
How'd you know I was coming?
You think you know me so well.
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
Oh! No problem! I...
We want you to marry her!
So, what should you have done?
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
I guess it was kinda funny.
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Doing it on this table.
Oh my God, so do I!
Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
Then don't touch one!!
No, look, don't touch that!
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
No, but he's always late.
Right, like the kind you...
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Okay everyone, think thick.
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Knock, knock, knock.
So now, what is this now?
No, no, it's just my tooth.
Yes, you're having a boy!
Oh my God, you look so good!
So-so you're really not going?
All right, so let's switch.
What is that sparkly thing?
Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
Him? Him, Ross?
Sex in his chair.
What were you modeling for?
Oh, so, how are we doing?
God, Susan is so fun!
That is damning evidence.
What's a Movement class?
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
So what's going on with you?
OK, is this really my father?
He's even kind of cute.
You don't like ice cream?
Ross, I know what you're thinking.
You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Stick a fork what?
There's no dog in here.
Why don't you ask him out?
OK, well then what is this?
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
You were supposed to tell her!
I brought you alphabet soup.
Maybe you could be my roommate!
And the big one's for me!
You're making one right now!
Not if I get there first.
Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
You have the power to do that?
Oh yeah, like you never called!
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
Here. Y'know, just in case.
Hey cool, mine too.
Whoa! I kinda liked it.
Did he mention us?
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Hey Ryan, what's up?
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
Yeah, you never heard of them?
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Ooh, God it looks bad.
Getting so good at that!
Just calm down woman!
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
So how did you know Francis?
You won't even taste it?
Never mind, I got it.
Should I not have told you?
And-and a power tie?
But she just came up here!
I know, I took it hard too.
What kind of an emergency?
Hey! New wallet, huh?
All right, that's it, I quit.
Janice? You called Janice?
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
You really thought it was perfect?
Well, so do a lot of people.
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
I stepped in something icky.
Well, do you see any babies?
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Hmm, how about my azzz?
It's okay to laugh right?
Sells drugs to kids.
You can't have sex with her!
Are you calling me selfish?!
Are you gonna go over there?
My guy is well read.
Do you like car games?
What does the sign say?
Don't get me started on that.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
No, there's no dog here?
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Sorry. How about over here?
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
I haven't really had any yet.
What-what are you talking about?!
Ok, do you know A minor?
Nothing! This is not over!
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Well, you know that psychic I see?
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Well hey, it's just a backup.
Ha. Ha, ha.
Watching ballroom dancing?
Umm, oh, about three months.
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Could you speak up please?
Ross, where did you get this?!
You should! How is she?
Well, can you dance at all?
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Um, not even a little bit.
Rachel has a new doll.
Do you have my birth certificate?
What are you saying I should do?
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
That true, I am flaky.
You're Frank's best man?!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
I wa-I wa-I wa...
I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
See there it is right there.
So how long have you known?
So you're not homesick yet?
Whatever! What about you Meg?
Oh I just miss him so much!
But you guys came so close.
Seriously, what-what's the part?
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
So tell me about this girl?
Ross, please! My make-up!
That's great. Good for you guys.
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
Fine, I'll go call her.
Oh, is this the bug lady?
London is stupid! Stupid!
I licked my arm, what?
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
Oh, I'd say about a month.
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
I don't want to hear about her!!
Well, if you think it will help.
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
All right, Joey, same question.
Does it look like a urinal?
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
He just got a divorce right?
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Hm-mm, corn beef.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
That would be great. Thank you.
Please...wait, how did you do that?
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Ahh, his work is done.
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
This is everybody. This is Ross.
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
Susan, he looks just like you.
Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Really? You can actually see it?
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
All right, so what were you thinking?
Good. So what were you thinking?
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Can I tell you a little secret?
It's okay. How's the soup?
She's right! You have to stop!
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Let's run towards them!
You know what, that's it, that's it.
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Well, he stabbed me first!!
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Uh huh. Why is that?
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
I don't ever want to see you again!
That you don't stop talking about it.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
No, I can spot you from here.
Ugh, what's right with them?
You'd already broken up.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Oh my god! Where are you?
So, did you pick one yet?
John Glenn is here?!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Fun Bobby is so great.
Surprise! Look who's back!
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Well, he made a move on me.
What is this? What's going on?
Alright, whadyou do with him?
There's sooo much you don't know.
My God! What did you order?!
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
I know. Hand me a tissue.
Going to the hospital tonight?
So now what's going on here?
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
What?! That's the first time today!
Monica had lunch with Richard.
Does Joey have any idea?
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
And-and you're using my name!
All right, what's going on there?
That doesn't lock does it?
I did, but that was really fun.
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Oh, all right. What did I have?
I, but you're so close! No!
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
Well, what period is it from?
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
So? Did you get the annulment?
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
I am definitely gonna watch that!
You never run on a barge!
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
Well, this is none of my business.
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Why? Why do I have to learn?
So, here we are. Nervous?
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Half full of looooovvvvve.
Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
Is it a meatball sub?
We should do something. Whistle.
She is so great! I miss her.
Oh, look what we almost left.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
'Kay, put your head back.
Nooo! Why would you think that?
No-no! I-I...I found one.
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
You didn't get the money, did you?
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
Wow, look at these prices.
How? How is your fault?
One of the babies is kicking.
It's nice that he has someone.
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
Show me the badge again.
My guy has great teeth!
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
No. I've learned my lesson.
Oh my God! How bad was it?
How can you not know which one?
Um you, you got a minute?
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
Excuse me, is this your car?
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
So when, when do you leave?
You told them he was missing?
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
What do you mean, comforted her?
I'll give you $1 for them.
Why would you kill his fish?
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
No-no, we do it every year!
You have chalk on your face.
Wait, you can't take the money out.
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Just get your nails done?
Are you still mad at us?
Shh! Get me out of here.
So, I'm here, ready to play.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
I got no sleep last night!
I know. This is really, really huge.
Finger sandwiches and tea.
Now, have you told anyone else?
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
I wanna hear "The Sound."
And you're so sweet. And you're kind
Come on, like you never talk that.
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
You didn't read this one either?!
Whe-where did he put it?!
Yeah, what town are we near?
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
So how are things going with you?
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Monica your remote doesn't work.
You're actually going through with this?
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
I would love it if I weren't here!
Yeah that's better than my way.
No that made me feel precious.
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Have you really done this before?
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
You completely stole my answer!
Wh-why is that the best part?
What, what are they talking about?
I'm having another heart attack!
Well, that could've been really awkward.
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Yeah, swing music is so out.
Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
I know! Robin is so gay!
Everything you've heard is true.
She wants to meet you in person.
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
What? You mean behind my back?
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Okay, so how do we decide that?
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
I don't use a curling iron.
Not a good day for birds...
I don't even know how that would work!
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
They have the best stuff in there.
So, what movie should we see?
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
Maybe your scene's coming up?
I don't know, you might be the first one.
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
Well when can we have this shower?
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Because I think it means more to you.
You missed a belt loop.
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
On a totally different bet.
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Oh hey! How was your audition?
Does it look like an ashtray?
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
You're all invited to bite me!
No, no, he hasn't been around.
No, don't look directly at them!
No, but you're questioning my method!
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
That's a good idea for a business!
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
You can't give up on your dream.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
I want to see what he wants first.
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
He could be in disguise, y'know.
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
Your middle name is Pamela?
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
No. No food with a face.
Come on, take 'em off!!
There he is! There he is!
But why does it even matter?!
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
So, um, have you told your parents?
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
We did have fun, didn't we?
Just, you know, to see... um.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
The name was my favourite part!
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Yeah she said something about crumbies.
Good! Good! Five points!
Which proves that I never lie.
She sells drugs to kids.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
So, do you have any other possibilities?
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
I can't believe you... ..did this.
My little brother's getting married!!
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Well then, you should look with us.
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
So was it a lot more money?
Good! Great! You can go first.
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Oh, fine! Take his side!
Hey hey hey! She's on!
I don't know. A cowboy theme?
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Nope, not knocked up yet.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Or you could end up with everything.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
Would you care to venture one?
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Me too! So happy for them!
What does she mean by HH?
Will you get us better gifts?
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Alright. So um, stilts huh?
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
Well, just buy the damn boat!
I never had a bike of my own.
Paolo made a pass at me.
Well, it's better than us deciding.
Because I cared enough to lie!
Sure. Do you need some floss?
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
But again, Simmons. Go on.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
I-I sure will, take care.
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
We stand firm at $10.
No! You should've read it yourself!
Open it up, let me see.
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Come on! Look where you are!!
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
And who else is going to be there?
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Alright, no, we could look at them!
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
You're still gonna go out with her?!
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
So how was, how was your date?
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Yes! She's very excited about that.
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
Like a date type person?
Well, are any of those people here?!
Nah. I kept myself busy.
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Wait a minute. What's his name?
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Which is why my answer is yes!
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
Which you just gave up really quickly.
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
We could have breakfast in bed...
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
And a small piece of chocolate.
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
That's too hard. Too hard!
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
And then... your face is bloated?
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
Living with you would make me happy.
So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
I love the license plate game!
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
God Joey, this is taking forever!
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
Cups? You're giving me cups?
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Then yes that is what I'm having.
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
But I already gave them back to you!
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
But we've only had one job.
No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
I won! I won! I finally won!
So that story doesn't make you cry?
So, what happens to the old guys?
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
So how are things going with Paul?
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
So uh, now look at the picture...
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
So did you sleep well last night?
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Well, I think I can help you get over him.
Does that mean Carcass is available?
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Thank you. We both forgive you.
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
Ohh. . .K. How come?
You've never asked a guy out?!!
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
I could've been killed I hope you know!
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
And a glass of tepid water.
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
Have you seen your guy's body?
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
You ate meat! You had sex!
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
Maybe, because you told him not to.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Who the hell are all these people?
Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
No, you have to let me in right now!!
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
No, but let's come back to that later!
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
That chick can't handle my corner.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
Don't even get me started on yours!
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
So did Heldi show you the place?
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
No listen to me! She is crazy!
No that is the last thing you want to do!
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
No Rachel! They got here first!
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
All right, the seven of us miss you.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
God, I hope they kick his ass!
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
...Then I've already seen this one!
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Ok so will he be back soon?
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Well at least we know she's a woman.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
That won't go with this dress though.
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
We could not, would not want to wait.
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
The woman who cuts my hair!
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
It could be like a big giant guy.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Well, I hate to eat and run, but...
The little jail between the doors!
No! No, the robots just work for them.
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
How about we talk about this over dinner?
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
Well then definately don't take his name.
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
You know who shaved you? That was me.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
No kind. He just makes it up.
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
I just lost a whole year of my life.
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
About how good your cards were.
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Then why did she ask us to...
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
We want the last six years back!!
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
You wanna work on your interview skills?
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
You two will have very hairy children.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
The coins have finally forgiven me!
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
If she says no, can I have the ring?
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
But hes falling in love with her.
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
Oh he knows! For the most part.
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
We have good news, look whose back!
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
You! An actor?! That's madness!
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Isn't there a national football league.
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Yep. Put more gas in.
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
They've been quiet for a long time.
North route or south route?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Since when are you into swing music?
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
What else do they add smell too?
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
I think on some levels she already knows.
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
500 bucks at a flea market?!
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
And because you're both, you know, white women.
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
So. You two are totally into each other.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
: Your Visa bill is huge!
Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
But at least the apothecary table is real.
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Right- where we've been looking all night!
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
How long has it been since you had sex?
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
That game should not be played without my supervision.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know...
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God.
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh.
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just...
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
