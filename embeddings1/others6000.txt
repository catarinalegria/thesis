All right then, it's settled.
You slept with another woman?
I'd really rather talk to him.
How you doin there squirmy?
Are you interested in this ring?!
So ask me what I did today.
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
Screw it! I'm having one.
The one with "Heston" on it.
Are you talking about having sex?
Can he handle the stick?
Yeah, she was my best teacher.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
I really like waking up with you.
According to recent findings!
Well that's wonderful. . . I
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Alright, let's take this outside.
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
Okay, now I've really have to go!
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Um, would you like to come in?
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
Just aim for the bump.
Why not? What's going on?
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
Hope you had a nice flight.
No, you've got to whip it.
Wait! You forgot your legs!
No help required Chico.
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Can you be my dancing partner?
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
I am not telling you guys anything.
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
Is this guy great or what?
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
So, who's the mystery man?
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
He went out with my wife!
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Do you know who at my office?
I won! That was my quarter!
I know a guy who's the 18th.
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
That's it. That's my whole name.
He's getting married tomorrow right?
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
As much as he needs.
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Somebody called about a monkey?
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
That - that's an idea.
Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Or so I would have you believe.
I know! It's awful. I love you.
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Err... we know what we want.
This is for the fourth grade.
The sex of the baby, Ross.
Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
Why don't we start right now!
No Santa? Was I bad?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
...Like, ...all of them?
Well, thank you for giving it back.
It got caught on my watch.
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
What do you need from the car?
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
I have a question about this scene.
How, how is this my fault?
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
Wow, you have really pretty feet.
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
Don't you want to know about the sex?
How's it gonna be all right?!
Go! Come on! Roll!
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Do you want me to check again?
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Ooh, steer clear of you.
They-they-they can smell fear.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
Now, which of you is the father?
Ah, which ever is closest.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
Wow, love your new nose!
But, you're not identical twins.
You have some life here, sweetie.
Okay lady, you're out of here.
Did anybody call for security?
All right, you have yourself a deal.
Why are you so jealous of me?
What?! What would make you think that?
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
You're right. Of course you're right.
This couch belongs to us.
Become a drama critic!
Well, somebody got some last night.
No, I ahh, had another idea.
Wow! You are really good at this.
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
What, wait, you mean like this?
You mean like exclusive friends?
You, get out of my shop!
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
He can have his job back.
And could I get my ring back?
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Doctors are wrong all the time.
Aren't you going to swallow that?
I want to talk to you about your review.
I'd love an ice water.
She got a job in L.A.
Your messages have been erased.
No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
That's my wife!!! Get out!
Is that an expensive blouse?
I came to talk to you about Howard.
Are you travelling with a child?
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
So uh, do you live around here?
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
I don't care! You just get him!
Uhh, you said there was a party.
Well have we finished the scene?
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
'Cause you guys were on a break.
So. I guess I'll see you around.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
Come on. I'll let you lead.
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
You are playing American football?
I was going to call him, but...
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
You can say that again Mac.
They all had a thing for him.
Can I get some ice here?!
I'll check the kitchen floors.
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Well all right, one thing happened?
Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Honey, don't bite your nails.
It's a good play, isn't it?
Checking to see if it's even.
Now get on out of here, you!
Scene 5, take 1.
What're you doing? Are you scratching?
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Any time you're ready, Joey.
Drops. Here, they're free.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Drake, what're you getting at?
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
So? Huh? What do you think?
Thank you. I'm from New York.
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
And wait, I've got something for you.
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
And I do have one seat left.
Ow! Did you just bite me?
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Do you two know each other?
Honey, honey, people are looking.
Well, we had a table in college.
Would you.......Would you hug me?
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Give me a 'for instance'.
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Oh look at you! So handsome!
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
I've got no reason to stay.
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
No, I really did forget my purse.
I've had a really good time tonight.
No, I was working on my pottery.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Okay. You ready to push again?
All right, you two, stop it!
That's why you broke up with me?
We're gonna give it another try.
Well that's not a third nipple.
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
It doesn't say that in the script.
Ahh, look at you, you look great.
N-No running in the chapel!
'We' would be me and Rick.
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
We kinda broke up this morning.
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
Are you going to eat that bread?
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
Um, yeah, I'm just... ..working.
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
That saves us a conversation.
No, let me explain! Fired!!
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
What? Do you think he likes me?
Morning's here! The morning's here!
Scene 5, take 2.
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Phoebe's got another job, right?
Stop saying that. I hate that.
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
No, it's too soon for you guys.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
You guys live around here too?
How long do you want the cuffs?
"You have two new messages."
That's where you pick up the bag.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
Well, whatever works for ya...
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
A joke they would appreciate?
Have a seat son. Hey!!
No, just a salad will be fine.
So ah, what's wrong with him?
May I see your boarding pass?
You guys tell them you were married?
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Do you know where the store is?
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Yes. They're insanely white.
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
I feel good! ...Who are you?
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
I think I lost. Three times.
Can I ask what-Come on in.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
We appear to have angered it.
Of course! It's her favorite.
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
You had sex with her didn't you?
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Alright, let me just get my coat.
Keep singing! Keep singing!
Well kinda old, like 30.
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
That's sweet. Could I take her?
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
So. How'd you guys meet?
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Eew! It's creepy looking!
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Yeah, move over just a little bit.
So? I mean have you thought about it?
The one in the director's chair.
Why are your eyes so white?
When's my daddy coming back?
Really? Then why are you like that?
You need to get out of my chambers.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Ah here, we brought wine.
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
A part of him did yes.
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Hey, where are we going to lunch?
I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
Wow! What an unusual cat!
1 minute 50 seconds.
And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
You're not wearing the patch yet.
Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
I've literally never been this happy.
Is Tony Randall dead?
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
So, have you kids eaten yet?
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
No! Why does he have to go?
So it's-it's not heeled yet?
All right. Here's your first baby.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
I can promise not to tell her again.
Just give me a chance too...
No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
But, you left the chair area.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
What'd you think I was, a hooker?
So you like the short hair better.
Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Really! You got a place upstate?
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Good luck! Go get 'em!
We could write it down for you?
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
I feel great. In fact! What?
But, he told me over the phone.
And who may I say is calling?
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
You're saying, my wife is in you?
When I was six years old.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
This is really hard for me to say.
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Hey, how, how did you do that?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
Aren't you with that girl over there?
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
No come on. Come on tell me.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Great. I'll ah, see ya then.
She's not much of a phone person.
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Then, you're redoing it because...
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
I think you may have a drinking problem.
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Ross? That opens my cervix.
Well there's one and there's another .
I like her. She sees smart.
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
I hear you can get people out of here.
Can I get you something from the bar?
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Come on along and listen to...
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
She's not here and please come in.
You don't secretly smoke do you?
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Ew, this feels very weird.
So I understand you're looking for a place.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
So how did you know I was even here?
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Nobody! We put them in here!
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
So how do you kids like your coffee?
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
Oh shout, that would have been fun.
Glad to be of help. Matches.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
My God, what were you thinking about?
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Is this about me taking your watch?
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Do you not want to be seen with me?
Maybe. Does that scare ya?
Nope! That never happened to me!
I remember when we first got engaged.
Yeah! As long as we're here!
No you answer it and take pledges.
Am I allowed to drink anything?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Guess what, I got an audition!
You found that handle, did ya?
So uh, here's your office set!
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
I think it was valued at 19,000
Is it true they have beer?
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
How did you know there was a but?
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
How, how can you be here and there.
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Why don't we take it for a spin?
Well, you kids take the train in?
I thought it was... quite tasty.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
No, she'll yell at me again.
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
No, she touched mine first!
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
You go get that animal outta here.
Comin' through. Move, move.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
Okay, I can let it go at eight.
Ross, they are killing you out there!
God, your hair sure is different!
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
So, thank you for the delicious dinner.
What?! I've never seen one before!
I am famished. What do I want...
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
So, what did Francis leave me?
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
Ok, this could go on for a while.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
That was great, the kids loved you.
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
I'll even let you ring the bell.
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
So what are you guys out doing today?
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
You're into hardcore S&M right?
We stopped at the gift shop.
What do you see? What do you see?
I see. Have you considered therapy?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Our little boy is getting married.
Well, call me if you change your mind.
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
It did at first, but not anymore.
Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Oh cool! You made him cry!
You're scratching. Give me the dice.
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Y'know what? We need to move on.
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
My breast milk is gross?
I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
Even if he were... cornered?
Why? Are we done for the day?
Why don't we do a trial run.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
No, but it did! Didn't it?!
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
This is from the woman at the bar.
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
No no no! Federal regulations!
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
Jack used to handle the finances!
So you guys want me to take this back?
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
Bye Joey. Last night was fun.
Ah well, this is the living room.
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk...
Y-, y-, you like that show?
One more chance Ursula, please?
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
No, let's just leave the lights on.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
They prefer it if I don't barter.
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Why aren't you at home in bed?
This is impossible. Its just impossible.
Joanna passed away last night.
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
You lost 13 million dollars.
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
How are we gonna get out of that one?
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
What can I say? She nailed it.
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
I am so attracted to him right now.
I didn't realize that she was so close.
Will you be my maid of honour?
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Right, why do you keep saying that?
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
You don't need to fill these silences.
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Oh my God, who died on this?!
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
It could've been a hair straightener.
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Fellas, these guys were here first.
I should just be happy to be near you.
So what. I say, punch him.
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
You by the door. In or out?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!

Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Why? So you could hang up on me?
What?! They wanted a scary story!
The dark of night has disappeared!!
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
And now you'll see me buying it.
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
First of all, it's on your ass.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
No! It don't go up on the wall!
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Did you cut this couch in half?
I was just being polite, but, alright.
Your grandmother would have hated this.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Saw Regis Philbin once...
Still rolling, annnnd action!
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
Sooo, you've been doing this long?
I am gonna try and quit drinking.
God! What are you, in second grade?
Let it be me! Let it be me!
You ready to go to the batting cage?
Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Saw your head. Saw your head.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
So, are you a member of any gym.
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
Which one? Which button, Jack.
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Would ya care to venture one?
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
Would you like to move over to the couch?
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
No but he didn't really talk about anything.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
We're still on this side of the door.
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Need uh, need a little hand there.
No, it was. It was very very good.
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
He better go on for what I'm paying.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
My God, you're choking! That better?
Ya know, she's having another baby.
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Uh, the usher told us to come...
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
You probably want us to move in together?
Looks like that might come any minute.
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Things change, roll with em.
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
Were you this cute in high school?
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
We really do feel bad about this though.
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Back on in 30 seconds people!
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
You obviously can't keep away from her.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
So... they sss-still seem normal.
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
No suds, no save. Ok?
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
...and live forever as a machine!
That was an accident! And so were you.
And who is this little cutie pie?
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
You have no idea who I am, do you.
Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so...
Really, y'think so? I don't..
My parents are going to be really mad.
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Think she got fired at Riffs?
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.
I was her accountant four years ago.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
No that's not true. That is not true.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
That you and daddy were not on a break.
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
How to make the next one even shorter?
All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
I got an extra one. You want this?
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
Actually, that's our three hole punch.
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Yeah I can, it worked real well.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Oh my God! It didn't remind you of...
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
You can watch our tape if you want.
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
I told that guy who answered your phone.
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought.
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
They still want me for General Hospital.
Well, you never told me how old you were.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
The game is over, we eat now?
So are you his mother or his father?
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
I'll just run to the store and get some.
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
Oh please God, let there be a song.
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
Well of course not, but you were very good.
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
What's this? Blue nail polish?
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
Did I put too much rum in here?
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
So that's your second marriage in two years.
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
So, I got the results of the amnio today.
I can show you an ID if you want?
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
You wanna go down to the office right now?
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Could everyone please take their seats?
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
You, you want, you want me to move out?
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
We want candy! We want candy now!
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
It seemed like such a simple idea.
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
And what will that be on the side of?
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
For all the free food you gave away.
That's exactly what my dad used to say!
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
You work and you work and you work on a boat...
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Your mom called me. So is this her?
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
But you know what might really cheer me up?
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
Well, we were very young when we had her.
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
So who made her queen of the world?
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
Who-who else is in vice up there?
I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
They're your backup singers... beind you.
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
And while we're on the subject of news..
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
There is a little child inside this man!
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
All right, thank you so much for all your help.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Well she said she had to think things over.
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
You know what makes the itching even worse?
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Call security. Pheebs, didn't you get fired?
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone!
Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
All those things I said about not being ready...
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
Your mother just added him to her list.
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
The pizza-place across the street any good?
You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
One swift kick and he'll back off.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
How could I have left them in the copy room?
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or...
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
All right, it's time to act, my talking props.
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
...of course you can kick his ass son.
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Now, let us try that again, shall we?
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
...says $30 Father; same as in town.
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Uhh, actually y'know what, I kinda-I have to take off.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
We've only known each other for six weeks!
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm...
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
I wonder how long that milk has been setting out.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before.
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight.
Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here!
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Right. Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Yes. Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and...
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then.
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
Rachel's coming up the path. Doesn't she look pretty. Jack...
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
Yeah, I'm all...in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
Yes! I have it right here. Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
You've done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no.
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I'll see you later?
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! Did you write this?
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation?
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...
Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to...
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch...
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so...
A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together.
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!
This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke.
What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love.
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart?
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done.
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back.
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less...
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know.
I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother.
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking.
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...
Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to...
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
I don't know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy... Why can't I just pick someone like you?
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.
Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go...
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you're surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.

Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Just relax. Just relax Paul, you're doing great. She likes you. She... Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y'know why? Because you're a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. I'm just a love machine and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! Showtime. I'm just a love machine, yeah ba-by!
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
