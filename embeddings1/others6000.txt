more wine dear
those earrings look really lovely on you
actually they were nanas
its like mardi gras without the paper mache heads how bout you

pretty much most of the time we have a kind of radar
speaking for my people id have to say no by the way your friend brian from payroll he is
yup and waaay out of your league
rachel rachel sweetheart youre a terrible terrible waitress really really awful
no shes at a faculty meeting
yes im familiar with the concept we can just look for it
well you know you have to take a course otherwise they dont let you do it
actually im reading it to the baby

noth i was i was just saying to my
sorry i wa i was just saying to my friend that i thought you were the most beautiful woman that id ever seen in my in my life and then he said that you said you thought
daryl hannah was the most beautiful woman that hed ever seen in his life and i said yeah i liked her in splash a lot but not so much in in wall street i thought she had kind of a
hard quality and uh while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace then uh thatthatthats when you started yelling
but you cant actually test this theory because todays particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions
uh thats definitely a uh valid question and uh the answer would be yes yes i was but see i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment because well cause its you
right but see the longer i waited the more phenomenal the kiss had to be and now weve reached a place where its just gotta be one of those things where i just like sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it and uh im not really a uh sweeping sorta fella

well its technically not a zoo per se its more of an interactive wildlife experience let me ask you some questions about is it uh marcel
does he uh fight with other animals
even if he were cornered
uh how is he at handling small objects

well if hes up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns youve got to give the little guy something otherwise its just cruel

i have a question about this scene

peel the onion first of all hes good looking
i think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that
it doesnt say that in the script
why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom
no and i dont think im gonna want to
yep yep thats what i didnt want to know
ahh fair schmair yknow look if you want to get back at ross i am here for you really nono i sayi say i say we get back at him right on this couch right here
yeah i can just go home and get back at him by myself
has become the penicillin of the twentyfirst century and so today this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution it is truly ironic on one hand consider the size
hey can i ask you something
oh yeah wasnt that like a year ago
oh yeah i know that
but youre not okay good
yknow what dont be this is not dont be cause its not so bad
i know im no john bon jovi or someone who find attractive im just i think yknow that you might end up feeling differently
yeah stupidly charming isnt it well listen lets you wanna get something to eat cause this place is kinda depressing
and the man who made all this possible mr peter becker
you guys make me fly high okay were gonna pick it up here tomorrow

all right its time to act my talking props
chandler is fantastic
oh god we just clicked yknow how people just click like he came by to pick me up and i opened the door and it was just like click did he tell you
oh and hes got such a good heart doesnt he have a good heart
oh i know and hes soo sweet listen he said he was going to call so put him straight through
dont spoil it
hello oh its you just ah just oneone sec i am going to take this call when i continue i hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call committing to the moment
he happens to be brilliant which is more than i can say for that sweater youre dating

hey so since were getting off early do you want to go and paint mugs
you know at the place i told you about last night
yeah i guess look what are we gonna do about this scene huh
well umm maybe if it had more heat
well adrians looking for a reason to stay right victor cant just kiss her hes gotta gotta really give her a reason yknow
or maybe maybe he could grab her and and and and lift her up
and then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and and his stomach
and then right right when the scene ends he could take her with this raw animal
yeah thats pretty much what i had in mind
why why he said hed call why hasnt he called
maybe hes intimated by really smart strong successful women
sophie would you please climb out of my butt why hasnt he called rachel why
awkward why should he feel awkward
the only person that should feel awkward is you and you didnt tell him not to call me did you
because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for there are always ways to fixthat
nooo and theres really no reason he should find out so ah lets not make a big deal about it okay

weve been trying to get pregnant uh pretty much ever since we got engaged we thought wed get a jump on things yknow no ones getting any younger
see the thing is umm were not able to yknow uh conceive
and weve tried everything weve seen a bunch of doctors
yeah and theyand they say that ourthat our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl so we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into

actually im dating at all anymore see i figured out that i was only dating guys that were like yknow bad for me so until i work that out
well i dont care about the divorces either but i wouldnt date him its just that hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl
okay now i wouldnt date you because you seem a little creepy
i am so attracted to him right now
you got married again
so thats your second marriage in two years
ross i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client why dont you tell me what happened
im sorry is this the same rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage
oh thats better then
i see have you considered therapy
there are a couple of forms to fill out
and well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh sound mind
and well need you and rachel to testify before a judge
of course you did look ross you cant get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there
oh dont worry im not really a party girl
so i understand youre looking for a place
oh i was going to offer you my apartment
oh thatd be great sure
ohh were kidding oh were kidding
well well well joey tribbiani so you came back huh they think they can do better but they all come crawling back to estelle
oh well no harm no foul
all right first thing we gotta do damage control
well i think uhh someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town
dr geller kurt rathman im a professor in the paleontology department here
do you have a moment to talk about your lecture
whenever youre ready
hold it im sorry the surprise is a new swing set if you could play it a little lessintense
thats where you pick up the bag
no the line is pick a bag so you need to pick up the bag
you mean dying man
hey joey were ready for ya joey this is alex hes going to be playing your son
okay all right uh alex now when joey says his line take good care of your momma son thats your cue to cry got it all right lets do this
scene 5 take 1
cut alex remember youre supposed to cry can you cry for us this time
all right from the top
scene 5 take 2
take 36 is up
all right lets try this again you ready joe
hello is ross there
yes this russell rosss divorce lawyer just tell him that since i havent heard from him i assume hes decided to give the marriage a try
whats happening to your accent
yeah thats what i drive i make four bucks an hour i saved up for 350 years
nice car
i love your car
i bet its fast
really you got a place upstate
well ill see you later
hey thats my car
but its my car
listen iii dont come to this city much so i dont know if youre crazy or this is some kind of street theater but could i have my keys
im not coming back
i live upstate
okay you two are asking the court for an annulment
so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr geller is mentally unstable
and based on the fact that mr geller is intravenous drug user
now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage
and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage well that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin
now if you were two involved in a serious relationship that really creates a problem
is there anything in this record that is actually true
well based on what i heard you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce
you need to get out of my chambers
would you like to spend the night in jail
maybe because youve got the keys
he has the most amazing porsche under there

working with blind kids
okay thats fine ill walk away and ill never bother you again but only if you tell me chandlers willing to give you everything i am
when the cretaceous period ended the dinosaurs were gone
i didnt ask you wanna come in

uh no no thatsart if it bothers you i can put my art out
so monica let me ask you a question yknow since we broke up do you ever think about me
yeah hes no good do you ever think about me in a noneye doctor way
oh whew
yeah youre saying you need to be with someone more mature maybe someone with a license to practice medicine or a mustache
i think thats fair
its okay shh hey hey shhhh

shes not here and please come in
okay she was here but she left
well she said she had to think things over

well if it helps it worked very well
you were gonna propose
no i dont have a ring you go get her chandler and can i give you a piece of advice if you do get her dont let her go trust me
i know i hate that
hi is uh phoebe here
well i dont know are you a masseur
great dad thank you so much ill be back to pick him up in an hour
so chandler youre parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged
i remember when we first got engaged
well id gotten judy pregnant i still dont know that happened
you dont know how that happened your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy
what they wanted a scary story
you tell her jack i cant do it
we have it only now we call it the beach house
were sorry honey but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself
which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put a price on that sweetie
we really do feel bad about this though
we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell so we redid the kitchen
well it was chandler we didnt think hed ever propose
we might still have some money if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet
it seemed like such a simple idea
stupid jack the word is stupid
all right enough i dont want to hear about it anymore good luck chandler
have a seat son hey
i understand completely theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your inlaws as a matter of fact when i started dating judy i was unemployed and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer
they never did so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along shall we
well if we learned one thing today cheese is that cheerleaders and high explosives dont mix

why dont we do a trial run
im the supply manager
we dont need any toner
okay what was wrong with that call
theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner but thats okay because whatever they say you can find the answer to it here in this script
so i think youre ready to sell toner do you have any last questions
hi god it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work
well its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling

sweetheart we love you just as much as ross now im sorry about everything that happened and id probably never be able to make it up to you but heres a start
its the key to my porsche well the key to your porsche
ive been thinking about getting rid of it i was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window your mothers right i do look like an ass

hey chandler you cant keep your hands off her for one second
ohho i think its nice
how are you doing are you feeling any better
wait i think i see where youre going but before you say anything else can i just say one more thing
rachel dont do this this is just because youre turning thirty
twentyfour actually
how hot are we
im going to keep dating him mother and theres nothing you can do about it
oh yes there is
what are you going to do kill him like you did with charles
that was an accident and so were you
well at least im not a murderer
oh my baby
oh just years of experience
can i get some ice here
youre not the fan whos dying are you
im supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying but thats not supposed to be until later
oh that was a real person
iiim leaving the show
who told you that
which one was it bald or was it tall
yknow what it doesnt matter because it is not true
and if it were true how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that ive been playing for 20 yearsill give you a tip
im 16
youre absolutely right they are writing me out of the show they dont know exactly when its going to happen but apparently going to be very soon and thats it
oh youre right thank you whats your name again
joey well thank you that is so sweet oh excuse me
it wasnt my decision
im having a conversation here you were saying
all right joey i will help you not because ii owe it to this stupid show but because i owe it to jessica
youre so welcome
is that supposed to be me
yeah but jessica doesnt have an english accent
so the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence so when jessica enters a room for instance she owns everything and every person in that room you try
no he already knows that he owns everything in the room hes not finding it out for the first time so try it again
right hes not angry at the room either try it again he owns it he owns the room it is his he owns owns owns owns the room he owns it all right its a little weird but its getting better oh well im gonna miss this woman so much i dont know what im going to do i mean its been 20 years of my life
i am i am but i dont know you know an actor of a certain age is not that easy
i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in but yknow i just got so comfy here and ohh i turned down some amazing work
well lets just say if i left 15 years ago the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today
but well now nows a different time for me
you think im hot
oh yeahyeah we should get the so when jessica kisses a man she usually puts umm both her hands on the mans face
no its because that way the camera only sees her do you wanna try it
that was good that was really good but ii think your hands maybe a little off they should be maybe right like
hi its tom im here to pick up the phone
no thats my assistant
so which one of you lovely ladies am i going to take to dinner huh
well you certainly own that room
well its nice to know that you
oh that explains all the womens underwear
id love to but my lawyer said i cant do that anymore
i really cant slap you
oh nononono being adored im used to it dont worry about it
how does it happen
ah what jessica hates horses
loosening the saddle on mothers horse was brilliant fredrick and the electric fence inspired
thank you sweetheart
i cant believe shes really gone look around you all of this is ours
whats the matter dina dont you recognize your own mother
cut that was great everybody thank you
that was so wonderful ohh i think that youre a better jessica than i ever was
