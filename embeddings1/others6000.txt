Oh wow, this feels weird.
Who are you supposed to be?
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
What college was that Dina?
Oh Joey, I'm hardly a...
Just washing the windshield.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Hey! Hey what's going on?
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Wow that was a big one.
I think he's across the hall.
Oh, howd she take it?
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Honey that sounds like fun.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Thank you. So are we good?
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
Joey asked me marry him.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Yeah. A year ago..
My God! What happened to you?
Just sit over there!!
What do you, what do you mean?
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
What?! You got us evicted!!
I didn't know there were docks.
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
I don't want you to see me naked!
"Oh, my, god."
No! I'm so happy for them!
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Ok, so let's talk money.
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
How is it going with Charlie?
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Well... Umm, I got TiVo.
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
I don't know where the phone is.
Is he romantic with her?
Tag? Hi, who was that?
Ha, I made you look....
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Well no, I don't smell anything.
What?! She made the tea!
That is the Coast Guard.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Oh! What's new in sex?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Have you been working out?
Three of your five, what?
Did you just break the radiator?
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
We won. We won!
Her dancer friends?
Huh ha ha!
Well, h-how is this like that?
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Oh honey, but it is just about...
Thank you...we're so excited!
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Oh stupid metric system!
Well, then can we meet him?
I'm just going to grab the phone.
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
She asked-asked you out again?
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
No Joe, no miracle.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
We'll be right back sir.
What thing? What is this thing?
Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
You are soo enjoying this.
Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
What are you, what are you doin'?
Then what? What do you want?
Say more things like that.
Well try to keep it down.
Oh yeah. That's a great story.
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
Ooh, your brother. Score!
I didn't know you guys hung out.
Do I have my own castle?
You want me to see a therapist?
We're paying for this y'know.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Wha. . . hey!
Well, I would like to have the option!!
Oh my God! That is so good!
"Yeah." "Me neither."
"Yeah." "Me too."
So what are you guys going to do?
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Come on! I think this is funny!
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Huh.. How about 600?
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
So you know how to fix it?
Okay. Let's use this brush.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
All right!! Fine! Fine.
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Where the hell've you been?
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Okay, I'm done. Do mine.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Because he's stealing from me!
Oh so-so not really never.
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Oh wow! This is so cool.
She you in the parking lot.
Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
Do you wanna play football?
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
You put these on my desk!
So, uh, how was your day?
Did-did you take these back?
Maybe you should put it off.
I know, I still need to talk to you.
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Probably just the first half.
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
She-she died Jill.
How do you know about that story?!
Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
God I'm just a horrible person.
Okay fine, what do you have?
That's the end of this conversation!
We have to get her a present?!
Wow! This place is fabulous!
What song was that, Pheebs?
Aww, look at the little thing.
It's open! Hi, Joe!
OK, then get me your purse.
Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
So now what have we agreed?
Whoa, how do you know about that?
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
You give me back my Walkman!
Really! That-that great huh?
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Because I knew you were lying!
Oh yeah. That makes sense.
You remember when we got these?
Really it's nothing. I'm just...
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
I think you should drink the fat.
You were gonna drink the fat.
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
No-no, I'm staying put.
How did it go with Erin?
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Third one from the left?
What did, what did he say?
I, uh, think you already are.
But we should move quick.
Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
What is this? Ross, what is this?
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
I've got some bad news.
4 o'clock. Food?
Eh. Beth dies.
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
You let Joey drive it?!
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
Yeah, that was a real good one.
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
I don't really care about the Knicks.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Really?! You think that will work?
What? You really think she's hot?
Oh my God Monica, who is that?
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
You guys wanna get some coffee?
Take it like a man, Ross!
We are looking at a Playboy.
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Here comes another contraction.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
No so we're protecting her.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
I just, I feel, I-I just...
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
You stole them from me!!
No, I think that was the whole all.
No. A break from us.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
You mean the one that you're wearing?
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Oh come on, I already went.
I meant, me plus one!
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
Let's dry 'em again.

What is this? What are we doing?
Ooh great! Very Monica.

It'll be a short one.
You're out of Diet Coke.
You're out of toilet paper!
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
I want the little round waffles.
Uhh, the mailman, the super.

Alright! Enough out of you!
How'd it go with Pete?!
AND YOU KNOW!!!

Yes. You're not asking are you?
Throw in the duck too!
Ross, there is no us, OK.

I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
What?! What else did he say?
Joey, you have got to take this back!
It's worse than the thumb!
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Well why didn't you take the job?
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
No, was he any good in it?
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Why would I have to sleep with you?
Well, look at that, same thing.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Really? You think that's all it is?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
About an hour ago.
I can't. Please, you do it for me.
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Why aren't you home yet?!
Excuse me, there was no time!
Hi! You're back from your date!
What're you guys doing out here?
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
You dont even have cats.
Turned out it was a hat.
No, yeah, Ive done that.
Are you breaking up with us?
Well relax, he'll be here.
Heey man, I work out.
I can't... I can't hear it again.
You've being seeing someone?
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Men just take out wind?

I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
Happy New Year, Joey!
Morning. You wanted to see me?
Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
And... taped back together.
Well, well, you said it was practice!
That proposal, at the planetarium...
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Op, I like credit cards!
That's a good story, Grandpa.
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
All right, all right. Let's go!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
It's not random, it's Bob.
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
You mean, you mean 30 days?
No, it was just the three of us.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Okay, well, we won that one.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Which one do you think she is?
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Well then I demand a recount!
All right, it won't come off!
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
Oh no, no, I'll be there too.
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
Okay, what? What is too sensitive?
You are having a party tonight??
Oh... what an interesting name.
How often do you read it?
I can too eat by myself!
Because, uh-it has to.
Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
We can't. We're not pharmacists!
I am so hot for you right now.
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
No, you know what, I think you should go.
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
All right, I'll see you guys later.
No, you could've lost your job.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Sure we should... So.
Op, ice. I need ice.
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
Would anybody like more coffee?
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Well, get back in there and talk!
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
She didn't hang up either!
She didn't hang up either...
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You want me to talk you out of it?
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
How is that the silver lining?
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Why did you invite my mother?!
Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Wow! I don't know, maybe. I'm...
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Well tell us! What are they?
Oh wow! Look at this place!
With ah, extra anchovies.
I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
Shake that nasty butt...
No you really think that's what it is?
Could tonight be the Night?
No its really okay... Monica!
Never happened! Good night!
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Yeah well unless we tell him.
I don't care about any of that!!
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
We love you, we're here for you.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Well, that's because of a lot of...
Does anybody want anything else?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Were both of those Joey?
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
Joey, did you my face cream?
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
No. I was just going to do this myself.
She dropped off a casserole?
Okay, well then bring her in.
Wh-You dated my sister!
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
You are undressing very quickly.
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Oh okay, I see what you're doing there.
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
You're just staring into space.
Okay, but Ross just listen to me...
Well, I-I could live without it.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
You are ready to make a commitment!
Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Oh, I read that in high school.
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Wow. She does that a lot!
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
Then what's with all the bananas?
I've never lived like this before.
Not even with your best friend.
What? What!?! You kissed him?
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Jurassic Park could happen.
Okay! All right! How was she?
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
Ok professor or detective?
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
You really think it would be that different?
All right. I'm a total pro!
Wow. There it is, I see it.
Uh, put your elbow in it.
Now that she broke up with you?
Ok Monica: We will!!
Pretty uhm, different huh?
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Come on, just answer the question!
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
I could not have done this without you.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Time is money my friend?
Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
We took our apartment back!!
Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
High-five, the babies are coming!
You went shopping for fur?
And all these people actually died?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
You just did a little dancy thing.
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
It was only 500 bucks.
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Oh please, you inhale your food!
So umm, what's this book about?
Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Okay, even this is turning me on!
Really?! So this has happened to you?
So did you break up with Joanna?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Well look, if you don't like this...
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Okay! All right, pick a half.
And your fly's still open...
How have you never been on Oprah?
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Oh my...God! Let me see that!
What? Did her ass explode?!
Does anybody need more coffee?
Chandler, can you give us a minute?
And you are a very funny clown.
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Well, then so you just invite me...!
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Okay, y'know maybe I should come back...
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
has your girlfriend got the butt?
Oh my God! My dog died!
...how about I move in with you?
Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
It depends on who asked.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.
God. You seem really, really nice.
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
Well what is it? Let me see.
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
But he has to know how I feel!
Any sign of your brother?
Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
What...how is it going with Drake?
You all know? Does Ross know?
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Well don't you have that big date tonight?
Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
No! God, would you just calm down!
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
He got it a flea market!
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Because I promised Mindy I would.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Great set tonight Phoebs.
I hope you're going somewhere with this.
Oh yeah! You really-You look great.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
Down at the docks again?
Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
So who else was in this club?
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
That's all right. And so it begins.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Could you please get her attention?
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Wow, he must like you the best.
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
Okay, go to the left. The left!
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
So it would just be, me alone?
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Ball? There is no ball.
I get to hire my own assistant!
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Well, why didn't you just take a cab?
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
So, did you shave your legs?
Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
: We have apple cinnamon...
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
And a crappy New Year.
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
Why-why aren't you more excited?
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Get out, get out of my apartment.
I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Time's up, now your dead.
Oh, you poor little famous man.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
It's over! You have to accept that.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
What, the blonde with no bra?
Oh my God you stole her award!
Come on, they were not that huge.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Let us keep the apartment and...
I know, I can do more than cook.
Foot rubs for a month!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
You didn't break up with that fireman?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
And that makes you angry because...
That's a line from the show too!
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Hey, that was an honest mistake!
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
He doesn't speak much English.
How long do cats live?
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Oo! When's her birthday?!
You are asking me to be your wife!
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Off to see young Ethan?
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?
Good day for married people huh?
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
How can you not remember us kissing?!
Great! We will do all of those.
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Ross, why do you hate our child?
I can not believe your trading me!!
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
I mean it's the end of an era!
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
What? Shut up! We're winning!
I haven't seen him in so long!
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
I'm just kidding! You can go pee!
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
I'll help you throw out your purse.
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
Come on, I don't know what else to do.
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
Okay mommy, don't ever leave me.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Somebody got in late last night.
Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Look, either help me or go.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
What, what's it, what's going on?
So can we keep this between us?
Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.
Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.
And you really think this is a good idea?
I thought you only met him once?
How many guesses do you get?
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Who are you saying "check" too?
You would do that? I never get picked!
Yes, we should. I think we should.
See? Now, he could date her.
Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
I mean he just started going out with her.
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
Okay that is the one we already have!
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
You have a play date with a stripper?!
But, but, Mona, I live here.
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
That almost hit me in the face.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
You never come into this office again!
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
People are trying to sleep in here!
You can't, because of the new skylight!
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
They made you head of the department!
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Take the top down did ya?
Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Okay, that we may be able to do.
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
How about 600 and these earrings?
Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!
Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
I'd need an expense account.
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
That's weird, she locked the door.
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Hi mum, put her back on!
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Hey, they were popular when I left!
Just give us our apartment back!
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
I am. Let me just get my coat.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
"Yeah. That works for me."
Get your hands out of there! No!
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Your fly is open, Geller.
This is how I would hold a football.
Call her! Call her now!
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
All right, then you owe me $350.
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
So, um, will you bring the truck?
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Well, there's two spots left right?
Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
Well now it's an empty bar.
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Who ? Joey: Me.
Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
What? What's what you were afraid of?
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Are you seein her again tonight?
Well those are very popular frames.
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
We are so gonna find them this year.
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
So you guys go, have a really good time.
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Amy! Yes I do.. I really do.
Why on earth would I understand this?
That is neither here nor there.
Wow! If only more people knew.
How could you not tell me you worked here?
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
No don't! Go back to repeating!
So, will I like any of these guys?
What am I making him by the way?
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.
You know, he was just doing his job...
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Make love? What are you a girl?
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
But you did! I mean, let's be honest.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
My boss wants to buy my baby!
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
He's perfect, he's never been better.
So were you guys together a long time?
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Grammy, Best New Artist.
You are so just doing this out of spite.
I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Sure! God, please take those off!
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I...
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
To get you to make out with him!!!
That really is something; that's really cool.
Ah, did I leave the stove on?
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Okay, calm down, here they are.
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
You took the same class twice.
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later.
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
You promised you would break up with her!
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
No way. No way did you do this.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
How-how did you lose your job here?
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Go get back on that case honey!
Hang in there. You hang in there.
The meeting with the guy went great?
Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Well I-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Some uh, some visual aides.
Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
They had to have that specially made?!
Oh-oh, that's a risky little game!
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
I got-I get a big pay raise!
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
W-What are you, what are you talking about?
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Well then why did you give me a ring?
Um, what- what would make you think that?
N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
So, whaddya think George is like?
I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!
I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors...
Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
And now you're watching me walk away.
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to cash.
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
You need to learn some new slang.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Open it! Open it! Open it!
You. Like you haven't done enough.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
At his apartment. Is this juice?
When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
What, because that's your answer to everything?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Alright. So where'd you grow up?
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Why does it matter so much to you?!
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
Have you ever seen so much crap?
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
What? You just click when they click.
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Oh my god, I left the water running.
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
I can't. I can't push anymore, I can't.
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Guess who we ran into today?!
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
What...that scene I saw was so good!
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
That's right! You do what the hand says!
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
I tried! They won't take her back.
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?
Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
There isn't. There is totally isn't.
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...
If I said I was, would you judge me?
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Look at that guy by the window, wow!
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
So are things with you and Joey any better?
I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Not unless different means the same.
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
He's coming over! He's coming over!
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
So do you think that my dream means anything?
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
How many ways are there to do that?
Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Well you could've untied it with your hands.
My due date is in one week!
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
You can keep those pants by the way.
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Oh God. It seems like forever ago.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
Well, at least you make each other laugh.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
God how long do you think that's gonna last?
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
And so were-were you close to your parents?
Oh, she's so tiny. Where'd she go?
Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!

Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.

Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!

Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.

Got a job on a river boat?
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
All right, well how much time do you need?
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
There were times when it wasn't even me.
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.

Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Well-Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.

Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Ow! Ow! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Oh. Should we send them something back?
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
We got locked out of the apartment, we ...
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Well, as long as we are clear about that.
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
And you were at this job for four years?
I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
What about all the women you want to bring home?
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
You are the official baby crier stopper!
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
How come we have one extra place setting?
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up .
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!
Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose...
Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
Really? Wow, this is so much better than I...
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Your agent called. You got that audition.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
We ended up having sex in his chair.
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Oh nothing I... Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Can you please, please take care of it for me?
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Remember when we were in high school together?
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
No, she was just much better at job than me!
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Hmm...maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
So, does this come in another color or...
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Oh Pheebs that's so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
A card! A card! I pick a card!
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home.
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
There is a hardware store right down the street?
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
Ross, you stay here and talk, I'm gonna go have a baby.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.
Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy.
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Don't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
NO! Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
Return them?! Shh! They're gonna hear you!
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay.
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
So uh...I guess we should...make it official huh?
Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits.
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster...
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Your company has a fine foods division?
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Please tell me you're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
No that's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth...
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.
Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
It is our first official date. Our first date.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Oh no, I really don't want any--Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross...
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?
I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Oh honey, don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow's the day.
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.
What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby!
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.
So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Oh! Well you're just the prettiest ballerina I've ever seen.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
So what's the final head count on my baby shower?
Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down.
I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
I'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she?
Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
Yeah it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's y'know-It's nothing.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I'm so relieved you guys know.
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out...
So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
"Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things...
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
Well, I'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!
I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm gonna get fired!
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Umm...that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
Oh yeah, I'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? 'Cause I'll do it.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
Uh, Paul's Caf. They got great food and it's really romantic.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
That's right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room!
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn...
Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um. . .
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
You guys, I'm doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
That's your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!
Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm sorry, semi-private? We , we asked for a private room.
Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Oh, thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
Oh, Very funny... Joey. Chandler: So, how did you enjoy the play?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What?
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! Come on little girl, hi!
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
You know the book says that whenever she's sleeping I should be sleeping so...
Just a minute!!! Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch.
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Ohh... Oh, honey here. Take it all. Monica! We need more candy?
Oh that's not important. The point is, I really-I think everything's gonna be okay.
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?
Well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.
Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Ohh! That's so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this?
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down!
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping...
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
No! Wait no! Shut up-I mean don't cry! Let me get my checkbook!
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh...tell him I miss him.
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Yeah, and y'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.
Yeah-No wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm...it's my boss.
I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going.
Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks.
Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I'm pregnant you think I'm invisible.
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?
I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't...
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
I didn't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to...
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I'm gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Oh no, I know I couldn't see it either at first, but it's right umm... Ross, I lost it again.
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
And I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this but, you're the best sex I ever had.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Wow! I can't believe they didn't put it in the part where you said you didn't watch soap operas.
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?
Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Yeah I don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing.
Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . "From Gavin"
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I'm gonna wake her up.
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
