I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
