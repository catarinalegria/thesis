this was carols favorite beer she always drank it out of the can i should have known
im divorced im only 26 and im divorced
that only took me an hour
you know what the scariest part is what if theres only one woman for everybody yknow i mean what if you get one woman and thats it unfortunately in my case there was only one woman for her
i honestly dont know if im hungry or horny
grab a spoon do you know how long its been since ive grabbed a spoon do the words billy dont be a hero mean anything to you
yknow heres the thing even if i could get it together enough to to ask a woman out who am i gonna ask
i assume were looking for an answer more sophisticated than to get you into bed
you got a job
the word youre looking for is anyway
come on you made coffee you can do anything
cmon cut cut cut cut
no no i gotta go home sometime
no no no go
okay you know you probably didnt know this but back in high school i had a um major crush on you
oh listen do you think and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out sometime maybe
i just grabbed a spoon
theres an image
yeah andand its not that we dont like the comedian its thatthat thats not why we bought the ticket
no its good it is good its just that mm doesnt she seem a little angry

anyway they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow
i have no idea no matter what i do though im still gonna be a father
i i think theyre great i i really do
do you remember the ludwins the big one had a thing for you didnt she
aw mom
im not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money
dont listen to your mother youre independent and you always have been even when you were a kid and you were chubby and you had no friends you were just fine and you would read alone in your room and your puzzles
look there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars with his museum and his papers getting published other people are satisfied with staying where they are im telling you these are the people who never get cancer
and i read about these women trying to have it all and i thank god our little harmonica doesnt seem to have that problem
okay okay look i uh i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me and so well heres the deal carols a lesbian shes living with a woman named susan shes pregnant with my child and she and susan are going to raise the baby
well yknow these people are pros they know what theyre doing they take their time they get the job done
must pee
how long was i in there
dya uh dya need any help
anyway um so you uh you nervous about barry tomorrow

look i dont wanna make any trouble okay but im in a lot of pain here alright my face is dented
hey this heyy
i remember the moonlight coming through the window and her face had the most incredible glow
look its just a little more complicated
little louder okay i think theres a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didnt quite hear you
my first time with carol was
it was my first time
fun where was the fun tell me specifically which part was the fun part wheres my puck
the kid excuse me uh thats thats my puck
oh yeah well im rubber youre glue whatever cant do it listen uh gimme back my puck

now that was fun
okay monica right foot red
okay pheebs right hand blue good
green to the green
not that big a deal its amazing ok you just reach in there theres one little maneuver and bam a bra right out the sleeve all right as far as im concerned there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close am i right
multiple orgasms
not even say breaking up with janice
oh yeah last week you had a wonderful nutty chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing nothing just just im fine
that guy he burns me up
so uh rachel what are you uh whatre you doing tonight
oh you uh you wanna hear a freaky coincidence guess whos doing laundry there too
me was that not clear hey why dont um why dont i just join you both here
yes i do have a laundry room in my building um but theres a rat problem apparently theyre attracted to the dryer sheets and theyre goin in fine but theyre comin out all fluffy anyway say sevenish
ok bye well monicas not coming its just gonna be me and rachel
its laundry the thinking through is minimal
so whatre you saying here i should shave again pick up some wine what
ok ok now what is wrong with my snuggles what it says im a sensitive warm kinda guy you know like a warm fuzzy bear ok i can pick something else up on the way
was your basket on top
no suds excuse me hold on a second thats my friends machine
hey hey hey thats not the rule and you know it
all right shows over nothing to see here ok lets do laundry
well thats because youre such a sweet gentle uhdo you uh do youoh hey uh you must need detergent
uberveiss its new its german its extratough
rach do you uh are you gonna separate those
rach have you never done this before
uh well dont worry ill use the gentle cycle ok um basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites a whole nother machine for colors and a third for your uh your uh delicates and that would be your bras and your underpanty things
uh that that that would be a judgment call
that does not sound stupid to me you know its like the first time i had to make dinner for myself after carol left me im sorry thats all the time we have next on ross uhoh
uhoh uhoh the laundrys done its uh its a song the laundry song that we sing uhoh the laundrys done uhoh uhoh
nothing nothing leelo the laundrys done
all right all right its just that you left a red sock in with all your whites and now everythings kinda pink
yeah uh except for the red sock which is still red im sorry please dont be upset it could happen to anyone
you got the clothes clean now thats the important part
what a beautiful story hey im fine by the way
oh shhh shh magic is about to happen
is it feels like two
he could never get a woman like that in a million years
no of course not yeah yeah it is
well yknow monogamy can be a uh tricky concept i mean anthropologically speaking
fine fine alright now youll never know
alright theres a theory put forth by richard leakey
oh yeah nobody knows and were not supposed to ask
oh cmon when we were kids yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasnt raggedy
alright you madcap gal try to imagine this the phone bill arrives but you dont pay it right away
because youre a kook instead you wait until they send you a notice
monica youre mom
cmon seriously joey whats the part
youre right youre right it isso you gonna invite us all to the big opening
look at it this way you dumped her right i mean this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful intelligent unattainable tell me why you did this again
no what happened big guy
it felt like a big guy moment
yeah i mean i think when its your shot yknow youyou know its your shot did it feel like your shot
she is a kook
and officiating at tonights blackout is rabbi tribbiani
pheebs what about you
disneyland 1989 its a small world after all
the ride broke down so carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children then they fixed the ride and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom
well it was the only thing to do there that didnt have a line
and you didnt marry him because
probably but you know ill tell you something passion is way overrated
it is eventually it kind of burns out but hopefully what youre left with is trust and security and well in the case of my exwife lesbianism so you know for all of those people who miss out on that passion thing theres all that other good stuff
but um i dont think thats going to be you
uhuh see i see big passion in your future
no no no im not in the zone
im taking my time alright im laying the groundwork yeah i mean every day i get just a little bit closer to
i will i will see im waiting for the right moment what what now
were shushing because were trying to hear something listen dont you hear that
im going to do it
you come out there youre a dead man
ok i have a question well actually its not so much a question as more of a general wondering ment
ok here goes for a while now ive been wanting to um

thing yes thing
no no no technically the sex is not being had but thats see thats not the point see um the point is that rachel and i should be er together you know and if you get in the um
no no thats not where i was going er if you get in the way of us becoming a thing then i would be well very sad
