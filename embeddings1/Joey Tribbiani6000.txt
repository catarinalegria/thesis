Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.
Hey, let's go look at it!
She's not crazy is she?
Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.
What's the matter with Rog?

All right, how about the ladybugs?
This conversation never happened!
A four and a nine.
Ooh...I hear that's bad.

She was kidding about that right?
Yes! Shame about you man.

Hey-hey, check out the hat!
... she's being unreasonable!
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Yeah, but it's not a big deal.
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
So, there was no miracle?!
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
I don't know! But it's the same!
Is it back in the cage?
Yeah, well, it feels different.

What-But you saw the show!
That is so not my motto.
Who you what? Who you what?!
'Cause it's a television show.

You're gonna have to pee on it.
Matter of fact, I do.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
What-what is it, what is it?
How do you know about that story?!
What? Me having a job?
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that.
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
It's like me when I was born.
Well, that's really a different question.
You opened them all?

And now for the great news.
Yeah that didn't sound like me.

I'll never get to be a best man!
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
All right! You can have the chair.
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Maybe she never got your message.

I would say, "Woman, please!"
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.

Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
Fifth day's a charm.
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Well, so, stay for the museums!
Me neither, y'know what-
And you feel like we hold you back.
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
That's because all people are selfish.
Uh, you gotta press the button.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
Oh what then? Kick me?
I didn't finish my five pages.
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Did I say you could smell it?!
So how you two gettin' along?

All right so, so what do I do?
Friends first? That's interesting.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
Oh, now it's a spare room?
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Wait. Give him a minute.

Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
So, you'd hire me, right?
Now, wh-what, what is that like?

And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
My chair heels itself.
You'd better act surprised.
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
What are you mad at me for?!
Uh, we might be leaving now.
So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
Err, "I think you know".
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
I don't see the baby. Where is it?
Or! You can just, y'know...
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Here we go! Here we go!

Dude! How come you took off?
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!

Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Okay, time to take off the bra.

All right, we have to pick captains.
It's not what you think, that was...
Damn! I am good at Cups!
Sure, I know lots of girls.
That's not what she said last night.
Saw a girl with that vest.
Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
Come on man, you're not a potato.
Will you let the lady talk?!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
I look more like him than you do!
Somebody wanna help me out here?
What the hell am I supposed to do!
Pheebs, I still need some help here.
What's he doin' in my section?
Oh my, would you look at that!
He cut off his ear.
She's not even cold yet!
Sure. So how long you been...
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Because it kinda looked like I did.
So, I hear you're single now...
Because you two were having sex!
I found my identical hand twin!
A woman in a man's body.
Needs some clothes altered?
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
He's back! The peeper's back!
Ooh, names? Opening credits.
See ya. Well, this is just us.
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Mike, 'attorney at law'!
This is it! This is my category.
Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
You don't wanna see what I just saw!
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
I can't believe you're not going to propose!
Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Do you want me to want you to care?
Hey, you're the one that loves the picture.
We were gonna go see the Jets!
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
I think I left a donut up here.
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Says who? Your mom?
Really? She... she loves me?
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Okay. Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Vomiting stories are funny...
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
"I need an answer now!"
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
Dude, you soooo need this car.
And you couldn't think of anything else?!
Is he still mad at us?
You're driving me crazy with that!
I want to go on a ride along!
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
What award are you practicing for?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
She even reads for pleasure!
Let's go watch it at your place.
The Irish gig guy?!
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
It's almost as if he knew.
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Say that to him and you're golden.
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
It looks like a women's purse.
Who's your friend? He's hot!
He's planning your birthday party.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
I know I should've. "I'm sorry."
Oh, "you do, do you"?
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Animals dressed as humans.
Come on, quite yankin' me.
Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
And of course, crotchless panties.
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Ohh, get these things out of me!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
But you two were supposed to be together.
That's a great story-can I eat it?
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
No, I had sex in high school.
Yeah you got 5 years left!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
Well uh...I think I want to take Chandler.
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
It'll be great for next weekend.
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
You're fake laughing too, right?
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
But you said he was this great guy!
No, they-they weren't in the play.
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here!
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
Can we please turn this off?
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
I am learning so much from you.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
Then why do you throw like one?
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
You guys are messin' with me, right?
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Ohh... I wonder if that dude.
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
Uh, hang out?! How long?
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Let's see what else he'll do!
That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Did that guy really make that joke?
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
Does it have to be a whole day?
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
Dude, you see right thru me!!
Hey, if you need a tour guide...
It's not that far! Just drop!
I say push her down the stairs.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Well, may I ask for one example?
What are you talking about? Keep it!
Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
No, inside good, outside bad.
I can't believe you guys went for that one!
Me too, we should get goin'.
Is that college talk for horny?
Oh dear God, let me think.
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
So, so, what'd ya think?
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Let's just say I took care of it.
If anything should happen to him...
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Yeah!! I call that London style.
With this ring? No contest.
You just give him a spoon baby!
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
Many are scheduled to appear.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
That is incredible! You are the master!
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Why do I smell men's cologne?
This is like the temporary robot, right?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Fine ... mediocre porn.
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
My whole family's from Naples!
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
So why don't you give me your number?
You got to go on a ride along?!
All right, let's get me back up there!
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
They did it right there on the couch.
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
They gave me the shaft all right.
It's like the cheapest college ever.
No! Year! Happy No Year!
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
But over the past few weeks...
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
You, you want me to help you with that?
Anyone mind if I save this?
If he goes first he can!
Forget about it. It's no big deal.
What are you in love with her or something?
But you're spittin' all over me man!
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Now let's not get carried away.
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Well I'm not proud of this, but...
Here, I got five, I got five.
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
What he wants to buy your baby?!
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
I know! That's why they trashed me!
Why?! Why can't she marry me?!
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Please, we're trying to have a conversation.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
You liked it? You really liked it?
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Oh my God!!! I can't believe that!!
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
He doesn't do much, does he?
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
You went through my personal property?
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Yeah, he's done some amazing works.
The silk? Feels really good!
Cookie, now you can punch him!
aaand SEND! Opening credits.
We could climb Mt. Everest!
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
That noise can only me one thing.
I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
Either eat it, or be in it.
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Yes! Yes, you're back in the lead!
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Why would he turn off the TV?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Check out the rack on this chick!
OK Thanks.. I touched the stuff.
Why are you taking this away from me?
He paid a lot of money for it.
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Maybe he's. . . gay.
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
They break your heart, don't they?
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
So you uh, have a...big work problem?
You won't boss me around anymore?
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Im sayin I see a difference.
I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard.
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Umm, well, what else could it be?
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
So, I don't have to learn what that means?
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?
It can't be me, I'm standing right here.
What, like there's a rule or something?
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
I'll take those to go. For the kids.
Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
....Are we still talking about sex?
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!

Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
You got all that from saline solution?
Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
As in Rosita does not move.
Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down.
Oh yeah? All right, let's do it tonight.

Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
So, does that mean the audition is off?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
The guy still won't put out, huh?
All right! But, you do it with me once.
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
All right, huddle up, right over here.
It's pretty, Okay date of birth?
I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
really, great, did I actually ask you?
I give you $ 500 for them!
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
That hot girl from their wedding?
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
We make fire. Cook meat.
They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
I.. I.. I need a good lie.
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Not much to tell there I'm really shy.
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
What are these, like famous chickens?
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
All right now, so? What do you think?
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani.
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
That's right! By his uncle too!
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
Geez, look how fat she got.
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Not knowing when to shut up...
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Was the chord at least right...
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
I've never slept with someone for a part.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Me too! Me too! Me too!
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
No! No, fear of the number 13.
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
That's like a woman wanting to be a...
You're right! That did cheer me up!
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
All right well, I'd better take that back.
Yes I am! Again so simple!
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya...
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
No, no... how come you are working here?
I just want you to say it once in a while.
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
Huh. So then I can heat this up?
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Did she just ask me out on a date?
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
We don't make enough fun of you already?
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
If you ask me to stay, I'll pee.
Those two only had each other!
How did she get me to settle down?
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Well, she graduated from high school!
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
Why would they take away our keys?
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
At least I care about his feelings!
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
You got all that from the back of her head?
Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Do you have any respect for your body?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Francette? What is she? A couch?
There you go sweetie... This isn't over.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Whoa, wait a minute. Who's the father?
What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
We could get that Everest video though.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Home is Home Star stew.
He slept with you and then never called you.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
How do you think I got him in the first place?
This isn't the right room, sorry folks.
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
What do ya say? What do ya say?
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
How about a scone on the house baby?
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.

Wise choice, how many rungs?

Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
A place to entertain my lady friends.
I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
It may not be a bed of roses.
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom.
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby...
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
All right that's it, school is in session!
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Oh my God Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
So you've just married the one time then?
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Yes I did! I'm Chandler. Dude, what happened?
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
How could you not remember that we slept together?
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
Now? You want me to go over there now?
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Let me get that. You got five bucks?
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
You really should have been more clear about that!
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
What do you like better action or comedy?
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Six months? Whoa that's rough.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Come on man! You've been here all day!
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
Huh. Okay. So uh, I think I'm gonna take off.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Have a nice six more months Ross!
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Oh.. man.. Ross and Rachel's Apartment.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
No, they're comin', we're waitin' right here.
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
I set her up with this actor on my show.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Oh, okay. I...I ate way too much.
Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
The hardware store is right down the street.
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
No. wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? Oh!
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.
Okay. Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves.
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Alright. Cab driver number two?
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
I can't! I-I don't have any other clothes here.
"I am what you made me! You know what?"
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!
Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
"Where'd you grow up," it's so simple!
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
How? I guess I could break down your door.
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
How long since you've seen a girl naked?
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great...
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Without that, you just got "lame with women".
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Yeah well we should order some food then.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Double promise? Call me when you land.
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this?
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Uh... How long have we known each other?
No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell-uhuhh!
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
We should really learn how to play the real way.
Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Molly ... people don't study acting ...
I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
Actually its not pies, its just pie.
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
Which we're still keeping under our hats!
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like????
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz.
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered...
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!"
No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your...
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
Uh, I don't even really know where I left those. Sorry.
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
No, look, I don't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry!
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later.
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
"I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
...look both ways before you cross the street.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
your right! I love my life! I actually did sleep with her.
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't...I didn't propose!
No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But...
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Y'know what? Don't worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
: That book got me through some tough times.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon.
Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
I can an A? In-in school? Hey, I'm a dork.
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in coffeehouses.
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?
I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
Oh really? That'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date.
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?
Well, there are so many things, it's hard to pick just one.
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
"I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it Thanks for coming.
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Oh my God. So that's it?! I only get to bring one guest?
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go.
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place.
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
Really? Me? Wow! I don't even know any huge gay people!
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
: Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.
Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.
Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y'know?
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you're gonna get together right?
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason...-Is it hot in here?
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ...
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Oh yeah, that's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys.
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything.
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Uh.. who has to die for me to get her? Commercial Break.
I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people?
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just "anybody."
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.
Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
"I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song.
Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe...
Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Ahhh! I heard "I do", we're halfway there! Okay! You!
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it... Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself.
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Now you can't tell anyone, but uh...I put on shiny lip balm.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Oh, it's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out.
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash...ists get down to business.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right.
You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy.
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it.
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and... Eva Trorro... womba...
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? There you go.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.
No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Good, good yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. "Oops."
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya...
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Okay, so that's another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that's...
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment.
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped.
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually.
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff.
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door.
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
What the hell are you talking about, "The south will rise again man."
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. What uh-How come you're not going?
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... I made it work.
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that...Man! That kid is going to town!
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let's give 'em what they came for!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I...want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all.
my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show...
Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. Y'know I was only kidding you.
Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you're all invited!
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters.
Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant?
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Uh... Look Rach... Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
Oh no, I can't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.
I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!
Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Name? I know Ross but what's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but...
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
Oh, y'know what? Maybe uh, you...you should come to me. I'm a not, I'm not wearing any bottoms.
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Okay, here's a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Okay. Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy's not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't...
I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not...
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me!! I'm blank!!
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight.
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
All right now... All right, you're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right?
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
seriously Gunther you should see someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE!
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don't like me for- I'm sorry I couldn't even get through that.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? .
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, 'cause then you're gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go!
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. ... and I smelled bacon.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! Well, you're cute, but you're not too smart!
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
Hey, listen to me, listen to me...you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it OH SALT BLOATY!
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I'll Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren...
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
Why not? You'll feel better! I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!
How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
You know, ah, I've been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it's not my fault. It's a natural instinct.
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.
Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!
All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah!
Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike!! Mike!!
I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
So what movie do you want to see-And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... There's no guy in there!
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Maybe! Well! Well...so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.
Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
Uh-huh! I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!
All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first.
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. so were good. I'll let myself out.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
That's it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?
Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me.
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good.
Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? 'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Bub!!! I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman...
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
You guys, this is Shelley, she's interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends...
Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Oh, that's, uh, that's Phoebe's friend's dog. I don't know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Your thumb? That's weird. You sure you're punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?
I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just...I miss...hanging out...just-just us, y'know?
Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a...
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!"
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
Absolutely. But, we're gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on.
see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious . That's not how she used it...?
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man...
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Right!"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"
Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Okay fine! I'm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!
Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
The thing is...'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And Ross...Ross is missing everything. So...
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Shh. Shh. Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay.
I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance y'know-I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!
No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . . courtside!
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn't have said. But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.
See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody said he'd be over it by now.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.... That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!
Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. Don't you people ever knock?!
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, "Duh."
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.
Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful...I don't think I can.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! That's for coming buddy. I'll see you later.
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
All you want is a dingle/What you envy's a schwang/A thing through which you can tinkle/Or play with, or simply let hang...
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I'm also a mento for the kids. Y'know a mento, a role model.
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close? Opening credits.
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"
No-no, I can't! I can't! Not after the other night, it's just it's...too weird, okay? Don't tell her I'm here! Don't eat that!
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to... Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Okay. Okay, so I'm writing you a check for...So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that...if you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father.
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great! Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?
Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
She looks so real! Y'know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and...uh-oh.
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern "I could go right now, maaan!"
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don't have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. Okay, you gotta say something!
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Are you kiddin'? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She-She's not standing right behind me is she?
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. Take a couple deep breaths. Look confident.
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves.
Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway... and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
I know, but I'm a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad!
Ah, just cut me a little sliver. A little bigger. Little bigger. What?! Are you afraid you're gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do. Joey: I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Oh my God! I didn't feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am...
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. Oww crushing bones!
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my pictures.
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
Anyway, it uh...look it'll just...take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so...
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Okay. Okay. Umm...Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so...nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so...
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh...I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
No-no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly...suddenly see them a different way?
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
Me too. I mean I...haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech...
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out...
No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice.
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris...Holy cow, that's a big word. Trisc... Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself...without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?
I am on fire! Chandler : Listen...this is really nice. Do you... Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
"You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for Bang End Scene!"
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing. TV: "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"
come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had sex here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Umm, now uh... It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
Listen I uh... It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y'know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh.
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out.
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look! Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
I mean seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn't and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and... I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas...and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I'll get over this." Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Monica's chicken parm! I'll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh-Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that's never going to happen!
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
C'mere. Hey. C'mere. That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you-we love her. But we can't have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You're a guy. Well, you used to be.
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?
Thank you. Waiter! 'lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails.
Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? 'Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
All right. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said.. He said.. "Joey you stink at lying." What am I going to do?
Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, So He Said "If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."
Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird." Or... or maybe just a wing or...
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do...so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray.
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Well you're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong.
All right. It's a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don't feel that now. It was crazy! You're fine. You're better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything's normal! She's just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh-Oh look! Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
Oh yes I do. Otherwise what's next? Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just...I just-I gotta change my pants. Jeans have no give.
I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything. Y'know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn't believe in myself.
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. Joey: Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.
Yeah, I guess it is. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne... baby...I'm gonna want to meet her.
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y'know it wouldn't kill ya to respect your wife's privacy! Stupid closet full of bugs!
I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw...a beautiful woman...bathing herself...but she was crying...
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. Joey: Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! Closing credits.
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
do you have any cake? >>> Joey's Subconscious So this is going pretty good. dinner was nice, got a lot in common. Victoria's secret huh we even like the same books. Oh now there's a scary painting. wait a minute I think I've been scared by that painting before. You know what this whole place look familiar I have definitely been in this apartment I know I've seen this weird plant before AWCH! It did that the last time. Oh my god, I've gone out with this girl before yeah we had sex on this couch and then on that chair and no. no we didn't do it hear which is weird because it seems like a perfectly good place.
I'd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I'm sorry. And-and some scared memories-Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple!
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
