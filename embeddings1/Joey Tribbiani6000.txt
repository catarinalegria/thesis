yeah yeah its like my chance to give something back to the acting community
good evening im mr tribbiani and i will be teaching acting for soap operas now um on my first day as dr drake remoray on days of our lives i learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting this does not mean acting again it means you dont have a line but someone else just did and it goes like this thanks thanks a lot oh by the way before i forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive all right moving right along
oh it was great yeah you get to say stuff like hey the bell doesnt dismiss you i dismiss you

ah now rach these ah these little women
how little are they i mean are they like scary little
these little women wow
oh yeah amy just burned jos manuscript i dont see how he could ever forgive her
but jos got a crush on laurie oh you mean its like a girlgirl thing cause that is the one thing missing from the shining

what are you doing get back over on your side of the hello hi im joey we havent met
hey robert could you ah ha pass me those cookies
hey rach how you doing with the shining
oooh the next parts the best when that dead lady in the bathtub

aww man thats the girl i was hiding from when she finds out hes my roommate shes gonna tell him what i did
what oh oh oh no no i cant i cant tell you that its like the most awful horrible thing ive ever done my whole life
all right okay it was like four years ago okay ginger and i had gone out a few times and then this one weekend we went up to her dads cabin just me her and her annoying little dog pepper well that night i cooked this really romantic dinner
i wish no after dinner me her and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out so i picked up a log and threw it on or at least what i thought was a log
i wish see i guess another thing i probably shouldve told you about ginger is that she kinda has a ah artificial leg
heard about the leg burnin huh
listen i ah i know its a longshot but by any chance did she find that funny
yeah you okay
hey how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives

well be there
uh 1030
yeah hey remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us
she was kidding about that right
god that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight huh
dude i dont know
yeah for sure okay probably want the first thing to be never open your eyes yknow because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see something you dont want to be seeing
ah okay eyes open at all times oh hey how do we decide where we yknow each would yknow be
yeah i guess but whats like heads and whats tails

days of our lives anyway youre not gonna believe it my character is coming out of his coma
andandand not only that im gettin a new brain
oh well theyre killing off one of the characters on the show and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body
yes its a highly controversial procedure
well i think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months
uh cecilia monroe she plays jessica lockhart
oh tell me about it and shes been on the show forever its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes
yes but in drake remorays body why is this so hard for you to get i thought you were a scientist
that was a great scene andandand that slap looks so real how do you do that
oh anyway i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are
no no im joey tribbiani we did a scene together yesterday iim the guy in the coma
anananyway ii just wanted to say that since im getting your brain when you leave the show i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
i dont know why did you hear something
oh uh one of the writers
ms monroe oh there you go
so you like the nachos uh myself im partial to
see you in 2003
im so sorry look if it was up to me you would never leave the show
no i mean it i cant believe they would do this to you and to your fans i mean they are going to be devastated heart broken they love you so much
uh yeahyeyeyeyeyellllllook thethethe only reason that i that i came up to you before was because well im really nervous aboutabout being you yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character yknow help me keep jessica alive please
oh thats great oh thank you so much
hey now ive been watching some tapes hows this jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again ever

so youve just married the one time then
yeah so uh ross well nowwhy did that first marriage breakup was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian

monkey lover
