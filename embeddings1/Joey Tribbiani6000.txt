So you uh, still wondering?
C'mon, she's your mom!
Did I not just tell him?
Hey, the fight's starting!
Are you all finished here?

Maybe she killed him?
Hey! He beat ya.

Hello New York!
Oh, you didn't see the Post?

Yeah, did I fool ya?
What if we have to pee?

"Happy birthday to you!"
Well then, do it better!
Well, back to square one.
You could drink the fat.
No way! It's mine!!
Face to face, yeah!
Ahh, you drive safe.
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
He should take the sack?
Well then let me do it!
That's a two line part.
Hat, milk, got it.
I was thinking Chinese food.
Say it... say it!
He's got the body for it.
Why would you want to do that?
Hey you guys! What's happening?
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
Put your hands together.
So, what did you guys think?
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
Oh, well no problem there.
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
So, are you ready to go?
Well, now we got a reason.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Good enough to get fired.
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Alright open your eyes.
No-no, she really is sick!
What's the matter with Rog?
"...by doin' it."
What?!! That's even worse!!
Who said it was for you?
So I guess you all saw it.
Damnit!! Did you move?!
Is that the fire alarm?
Okay, here we go. Ready?
You bet! What's the part?
All right, how about the ladybugs?
The Ross-Is that back?!!
Go get 'em Treeger.

Quick volleyball question.

Yes! Shame about you man.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Hey, let's go look at it!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Come on baby, come on!

People, people, people.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Sorry. Wrong boobies.

Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Need a new table.
Let me see. Oh, right.
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Well, first it's not a purse.
I've got cold feet.
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
They were in his office.
What's wrong with the twentieth?
I don't want to, I'm scared.
How can they do this to me?
A four and a nine.
If you don't do it, I will.
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
I'll treat you real nice.
Beth, Beth dies?
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
He's doin' some thinkin'!
My identical hand twin!
I will not take this abuse.
Whoa. That was really good.
That's not funny at all!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
You know, I think I was sixteen.
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
Why is 10 the highest?
Yes! There's still pie.
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
You play hard to get.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Hey-hey, check out the hat!
Do we have to know about that?
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
So we are going on two?
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Aww, I don't want to see that!
Right, I go-, I got it.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Is it back in the cage?
Okay, may I see the comics?
Somebody help me out here!
See, this is a great apartment.
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
So, there was no miracle?!
Oh well, okay, good luck.
She was kidding about that right?
No, can we get back to me?
What-But you saw the show!
She's not crazy is she?
Now she sounded breezy.
That is so not my motto.
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Sure! Where are the seats?
Then you hold on to it!!
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
No no no, behind it.
Is ah, is Chandler around?
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
All right, what are we havin'?
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Exellent dream score.

Hey, there's a dog out there!
And now for the great news.
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Yeah, where the hell is he?
'Cause it's a television show.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
I, um, can't tell you.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
All right Phoebs, way to go.
Dude you said, "No!"
But, he loves Emily?
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
Okay. See?! I told ya!
What? Me having a job?
She keeps punching me.
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
What-what is it, what is it?
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Oh yeah, I added three.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
Spock's birth control.
You got that from what I said?!
I don't know! But it's the same!
Still not hot enough!
I don't know how to play Cups.
Who you what? Who you what?!
How far'd ya get?
Heh, what d'ya say?
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Great, you can cover Chandler.
Well, that's really a different question.
Get out of here, really?!
You wanna see her again, right?
They're brother and sister!!!
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Look, it was a job all right?
Hang up, hang up.
You're gonna have to pee on it.
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
The fruit roll up.

Okay, I see what's going on here.
Oh well then, good night!
That-that is a good trick.
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Yep! Grab a plate.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
I can scratch that right off.
Well, they go into the chipper.
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
Did you get your money back?
That guy's still doing that?!
Was his name Angus?
Kate, do you even like me?
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
Funny one! That's good!
Yes! And the table is mine.
You see this, this is a friend.
Then why would you say that?!
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Some girl ate Monica.
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
Duh, where've you been?
So, so how did it happen?
Aw, I know all about Kip!
I have actually not heard of that.
Where the hell have you been?!
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Oh, just, y'know.... science.

All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Ma! What're you doing here?
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
How do you do there, Wayne?
This will just be my batch.
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Hey! Is the show still on?
Very good! Okay. G.
Look, what do you want me to say?
Okay, get ready to owe me!
It certainly is a miracle.
Why, are you moving out?
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
So you're really doing this, huh?
I don't know, it looks the same.
I didn't know it was an auction!
Can you tell me how this happened?
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
I can't! It-it's stuck!
You want to see her again, right?
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Morning. We ready to go?
I know! Neither did I!
Way to be strong, man!
You want me to lie to Chandler?
Which, is the new plan!
Really? Who-who have you taught?
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Well he made Rachel cry!
Mom, so what did you think?
Has it been that long?!
It's okay, these things happen.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.

Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
They didn't fight a lot?
Can I talk to you for a second?!
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
But what does that gonna do...
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Now, don't argue with me...
I know. Ross is getting married.
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Joseph's good, isn't he?
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Hold on, you-you knew?
All right! So, was it amazing?
No, I'm alright man. Really.
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
So, we're having fun, right?
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Well, I think we all learned something.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
What are you guys woofing about?
So I guess it's Joey then!
Hey buddy! How's it going?
That's right, I have a phone in here.
So he likes to break stuff.
"When can you move in?"
Hey, how was your chef thing?
No you're not! Not to me!
Why don't we just go on two.
Two brothers, one died!
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
How'd you get over that teacher?
You think I need a new walk?
All right, I'll take care of it.
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
What? No-no it's her birthday!
Look, you wanna use our place?
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
No, that means nothin to me.
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Not from where I was standin.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...

I won! That was my guess!
Your other student, was you!
You wanna eat? My treat!
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Come on look guys, don't fight.
All right! You can have the chair.
My Giant? I love that movie!
I'll never get to be a best man!
Maybe she never got your message.
She was nothing compared to you.
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
There was a seen in Footloose...
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
What? That's not? Oh my God.
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
Okay, you watch too much TV.

Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Man, do you know what guys want!
Who wants French toast?
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
Good luck. And I'm still right!
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
Me neither, y'know what-

What are you talking about? Bitch.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!

Yeah it is. . . what?
Then you do. Heh, heh.
Sure, what do you want to see?
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.

Well, so, stay for the museums!
I bet it was about her a little.
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
But, but wh-what about us?
You know what the. . .
So how you two gettin' along?
Can I tell you something? Me too.
We're 29, we're not women.
So did that do anything for ya?
Come on, I need your help here.
Hard to tell, I was naked.
I'll be right back. What was that?
I came over here to tell you guys.
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Come on man, really how old?!
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Friends first? That's interesting.
No it isn't, I ate that.
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
Sure, neighbor come on in.
Judge rules, no violation.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
No! He blew us off!
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
I have never known love like this.
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Come on you guys, one more time.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Have you been here all night?
Y'know, there's two women dude.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
What's the game?! What's the game?!
When do you think we lost her?
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
Alright... I've got to go shower.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
I figure my character has kids.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
No! Never! Never! Bye.
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
What? Mine aren't tinted.
So, you'd hire me, right?
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Wait. Give him a minute.
That's because all people are selfish.
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
What are you mad at me for?!
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
You'd better act surprised.
And you feel like we hold you back.
Beth is really, really sick.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
He cut off his ear.
Uh, we might be leaving now.
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
No. Rosita does not move.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Saw a girl with that vest.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
Hey, do we do this too much?
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
It's not what you think, that was...
Did I say you could smell it?!
Will you quit hoggin' it!
My chair heels itself.
Come on man, you're not a potato.
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
What's he doin' in my section?
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
What happens if you flick it?
I didn't finish my five pages.
Damn! I am good at Cups!
Now, wh-what, what is that like?
I found my identical hand twin!
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
He's back! The peeper's back!
Our place, the hall! I...
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Needs some clothes altered?
She's not even cold yet!
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
All right, we have to pick captains.
This is it! This is my category.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
Vomiting stories are funny...
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Because! You're mean on the boat!
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Dude! How come you took off?
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
I look more like him than you do!
Oh, now it's a spare room?
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Sure. So how long you been...
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
That's not what she said last night.
And of course, crotchless panties.
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Or! You can just, y'know...
Do you want me to want you to care?
I think I left a donut up here.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Say that to him and you're golden.
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Come on! You like this woman, right?
A woman in a man's body.
I want to go on a ride along!
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
It looks like a women's purse.
Oh my, would you look at that!
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
What award are you practicing for?
By someone besides Monica?
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?

Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
You're driving me crazy with that!
So Pheebs what's this guy like?

Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
This is like the temporary robot, right?
That is incredible! You are the master!
Well, may I ask for one example?
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
No, inside good, outside bad.
My whole family's from Naples!
You just give him a spoon baby!
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
Does it have to be a whole day?
Me too, we should get goin'.

Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
With this ring? No contest.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Here, I got five, I got five.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
If he goes first he can!
Let's see what else he'll do!
You got to go on a ride along?!
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
All right, let's get me back up there!
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
So why don't you give me your number?
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
They gave me the shaft all right.
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
If anything should happen to him...
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Oh dear God, let me think.
They did it right there on the couch.
But you're spittin' all over me man!
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Anyone mind if I save this?
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
We could climb Mt. Everest!
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Uh, hang out?! How long?
I know! That's why they trashed me!
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
The silk? Feels really good!
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
I fell down an elevator shaft.
I just got off the phone with my sister.
What are you in love with her or something?
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.

And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Check out the rack on this chick!
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Cookie, now you can punch him!
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
They break your heart, don't they?
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Im sayin I see a difference.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Maybe he's. . . gay.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Why would he turn off the TV?
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
What, like there's a rule or something?
As in Rosita does not move.
....Are we still talking about sex?
He doesn't do much, does he?
He paid a lot of money for it.
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
You got all that from saline solution?
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
We make fire. Cook meat.
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Umm, well, what else could it be?
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Why are you taking this away from me?
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
You won't boss me around anymore?
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
You went through my personal property?
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
I wanna rock and roll all night!
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
What are these, like famous chickens?
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
So, does that mean the audition is off?
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
All right, huddle up, right over here.
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
All right! But, you do it with me once.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
The guy still won't put out, huh?
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Was the chord at least right...
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Geez, look how fat she got.
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Those two only had each other!
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
You're right! That did cheer me up!
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .

Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.

Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?

Home is Home Star stew.
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.

Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Me too! Me too! Me too!
All right now, memorize it. You got it?

Ew! What is that? Something exploded!

You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!

Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
So you ah, ready for our last practice?

Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
You got all that from the back of her head?
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.

You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
How about a scone on the house baby?
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Was she happy you gave her the job?
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right

Ah, anything we might of heard of?
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
What do you like better action or comedy?
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?

Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Let me get that. You got five bucks?
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
You practice losing the Grammies too?
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
So you've just married the one time then?
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
"Take good care of your Momma son."
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!

Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!

Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Your sister stood me up the other night.
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Yeah well we should order some food then.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
We should really learn how to play the real way.
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
That tone will not make me go any faster.
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
: That book got me through some tough times.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
