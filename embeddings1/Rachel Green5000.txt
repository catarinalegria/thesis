and that crazy party animal will be your brotherinlaw
umm chandler you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monicas head
well because she loves you and because you love her
hey chandler dont freak out im telling you something you already know come on she broke up with richard because he didnt want to have babies and shes a woman and shes almost 30 and yknow its monica

hey joey would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch
yknow honey umm as uh as flattered as i am that uh you saw me first uhh i just ii dont think we should be cranking anything up
yeah well yknow umm no honey listen i think its a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them but i think the way you do it is yknow you meet someone become their friend build a foundation then you ask them out on a date dont hit on your existing friends
yeah yeah oh but once you find it ohh its so worth the wait
hey ross i brought reinforcements
well i brought the next best thing
whoaoh whatswhats that

good you guys are all here
well i have a job interview at ralph lauren tomorrow
anyway im going to be the coordinator of the womans collection ill work right under the director its the perfect perfect job for me
ugh horrible i did the stupidest most embarrassing thing
ugh it was horrible andand the interview part went so well yknow i even made him laugh he said something about a boat and i was like well yeah if youve got enough life jackets trust me it was actually it was very funny anyway so we were saying goodbye and ugh
all right we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me yknow maybe he was going to open the door but i totally miss read him and i uhhh
well i didnt know what else to do
i cant believe it i got a second interview
whatwhat wait a minute you dont think thats why he wants me back
i accidentally kissed him in the interview and now he wants me back yknow of course cause lets bring the girl back who kisses everybody
oh my god what if he thinks im the kind of girl thatthat would just sleep with him
maybe ii dont knowoh god how could i be so stupid
ohh well im not totally back yet but thank you
whwhoa all right okayokay i see i see whats going on here now listen looklook im sorry if i gave you the wrong impression but i am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead now even though i  heyheyhey even though i kissed you that does not give you the right to demand sex from me i do not want this job that bad good day sir
ugh you will not believe what that sleazeball from ralph lauren did too me
okayokay thatthats amazing how did you know that
oh ohhhhhhhhh
ah first ii would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again
okay umm well first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh for yelling at you
now youre probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah who did who did not umm yell at you and storm out and i think thats a big mistake and heres why i made a huge fool of myself and i came back that shows courage when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job i said no that shows integrity and i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage okay umm now i know i already said courage but yknow you gotta have courage and umm and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace i said no and i was not litigious by the way litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against so she didnt want to sue him dont worry i had to look it up too so there you go you got you got courage you got integrity you got courage again and not litigious look mr
zelner right i knew that i really really want this job and i think i think i would be really good at it

well yknow this whole marriage thing kinda my idea
well remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married
and uh yeah i didnt really i didnt want to say anything but it kinda it just it kinda kept coming back to me and umm remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes and uh and i thought it would be funnier if we got married so as a as a compromise we decided first to get married and then to eat a lot of grapes so umm sorry i got us into this mess
yeah dont push it though
i know i always thought if you and i got married it would be the one that stuck and it wouldnt be a secret and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at pizza hut
no it was on the house it was it was a newlywed special
hey thanks ross for taking care of all of this
im gonna need a copy of those

look at it isnt it beautiful
its a truffle its got all of these layers first theres a layer of ladyfingers then a layer of jam then custard which i made from scratch then raspberries more ladyfingers then beef sauteed with peas and onions then a little more custard and then bananas and then i just put some whipped cream on top
the beef yeah that was weird to me too but then yknow i thought well theres mincemeat pie i mean thats an english dessert these people just put very strange things in their food yknow oh by the way can i borrow some rum from your place
and while im gone dont you boys sneak a taste
joey god your apartment is like a hundred degrees
no i did but tell me again because its so romantic
joey come on i dont wanna make any mistakes alright this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybodys gonna be like oh remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle

well look if you dont like this
come on joey i just bought you a new chair the most expensive one in the store hey yknow what i was thinking we could name her francette
joey the new chair will be here in an hour maybe we should actually move rosita out of here yknow start the heeling process
its not a miracle joey im sure theres some explanation
joey i really dont
no yknow what maybe somebody came in here and fixed it or something
thats right joey the chair angel came in and heeled your chair
i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself
hey howshows the uh miracle chair
yeah wow yknow that this thing has speakers in the headrest
yeah you can hook it up to your tv and you get radio
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines has a rolling massage and speakers in the head rest
well what if i told you you can do it in my apartment
i just purchased the lazboy ecliner 3000
well its a long story but umm i broke joeys chair

yeah he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs
no joe no miracle
uhhuh nice try but you dont get that chair anymore all right that is my chair now you can sit on my lap no i take that back
nonono this chairs not going anywhere
the logic is that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half
were the cobras
oh yeah joey broke it had to get rid of it

as i was saying i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time im 35 which gives me five years i love this plan i wanna marry this plan
so if i wanna have my kid when im 35 i dont have to get pregnant until im 34 which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes oh wait but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant
no so i dont have to get married until im 33 thats three years thats three whole yearsoh wait a minute though ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding and id like to know the guy for a year year and a half before we get engaged which means i need to meet the guy by the time im thirty
