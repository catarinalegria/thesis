more wine dear
those earrings look really lovely on you
actually they were nanas
its like mardi gras without the paper mache heads how bout you
i know thats what i told her
pretty much most of the time we have a kind of radar
speaking for my people id have to say no by the way your friend brian from payroll he is
yup and waaay out of your league
rachel rachel sweetheart youre a terrible terrible waitress really really awful
no shes at a faculty meeting
yes im familiar with the concept we can just look for it
well you know you have to take a course otherwise they dont let you do it
actually im reading it to the baby
what you dont think they can hear sounds in there
yeah all the time i want the baby to know my voice
yeah yeah all the time
but um we just refer to you as bobo the sperm guy
really you dont know what that means to me
i just remembered i have to do something

noth i was i was just saying to my
sorry i wa i was just saying to my friend that i thought you were the most beautiful woman that id ever seen in my in my life and then he said that you said you thought
daryl hannah was the most beautiful woman that hed ever seen in his life and i said yeah i liked her in splash a lot but not so much in in wall street i thought she had kind of a
hard quality and uh while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace then uh thatthatthats when you started yelling
but you cant actually test this theory because todays particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions
uh thats definitely a uh valid question and uh the answer would be yes yes i was but see i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment because well cause its you
right but see the longer i waited the more phenomenal the kiss had to be and now weve reached a place where its just gotta be one of those things where i just like sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it and uh im not really a uh sweeping sorta fella

well its technically not a zoo per se its more of an interactive wildlife experience let me ask you some questions about is it uh marcel
does he uh fight with other animals
even if he were cornered
uh how is he at handling small objects
how about a hammer or a small blade
well if hes up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns youve got to give the little guy something otherwise its just cruel
