it was a really beautiful service
wow those pills really worked huh
well sure what with it being her funeral and all
that sounds like nana
that is a wonder so tell me something mom if you had to do it all over again i mean if she was here right now would you tell her
how she drove you crazy picking on every little detail like your hair for example
do you think things would have been better if youd just told her the truth
oh i think so
thank you theyre yours
hey ross did you know mom and dad are going to puerto rico for thanksgiving
