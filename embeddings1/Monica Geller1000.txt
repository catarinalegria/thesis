I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
