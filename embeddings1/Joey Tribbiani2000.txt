yeah yeah its like my chance to give something back to the acting community
good evening im mr tribbiani and i will be teaching acting for soap operas now um on my first day as dr drake remoray on days of our lives i learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting this does not mean acting again it means you dont have a line but someone else just did and it goes like this thanks thanks a lot oh by the way before i forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive all right moving right along
oh it was great yeah you get to say stuff like hey the bell doesnt dismiss you i dismiss you

ah now rach these ah these little women
how little are they i mean are they like scary little
these little women wow
oh yeah amy just burned jos manuscript i dont see how he could ever forgive her
but jos got a crush on laurie oh you mean its like a girlgirl thing cause that is the one thing missing from the shining

what are you doing get back over on your side of the hello hi im joey we havent met
hey robert could you ah ha pass me those cookies
hey rach how you doing with the shining
oooh the next parts the best when that dead lady in the bathtub

aww man thats the girl i was hiding from when she finds out hes my roommate shes gonna tell him what i did
what oh oh oh no no i cant i cant tell you that its like the most awful horrible thing ive ever done my whole life
all right okay it was like four years ago okay ginger and i had gone out a few times and then this one weekend we went up to her dads cabin just me her and her annoying little dog pepper well that night i cooked this really romantic dinner
i wish no after dinner me her and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out so i picked up a log and threw it on or at least what i thought was a log
i wish see i guess another thing i probably shouldve told you about ginger is that she kinda has a ah artificial leg
heard about the leg burnin huh
listen i ah i know its a longshot but by any chance did she find that funny
yeah you okay
hey how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives

well be there
uh 1030
yeah hey remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us
she was kidding about that right
god that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight huh
dude i dont know
yeah for sure okay probably want the first thing to be never open your eyes yknow because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see something you dont want to be seeing
ah okay eyes open at all times oh hey how do we decide where we yknow each would yknow be
yeah i guess but whats like heads and whats tails
