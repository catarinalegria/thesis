you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason
i miss janice though hello chandler bing
ok its very faint but i can still sense him in the building go into the light mr heckles
im sorry but sometimes they need help thats fine go ahead and scoff you know therere a lot of things that i dont believe in but that doesnt mean theyre not true
like crop circles or the bermuda triangle or evolution
nah not really
i dont know its just you knowmonkeys darwin you know its a its a nice story i just think its a little too easy
yeah i just dont buy it

well its not so much that you know like i dont believe in it you know its justi dont know lately i get the feeling that im not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed
just dont look at this funky shirt
really you can actually see it
huh so now the real question is who put those fossils there and why
maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts
look cant we just say that you believe in something and i dont
what is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you no whats that all about i think i think maybe its time you put ross under the microscope
hes even kind of cute
id call that excessive
janice you called janice
uhoh its scary scientist man
ok look before you even start im not denying evolution ok im just saying that its one of the possibilities
ok ross could you just open your mind like this much ok wasnt there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat and up until like what 50 years ago you all thought the atom was the smallest thing until you split it open and this like whole mess of crap came out now are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you cant admit that theres a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this
i cant believe you caved
you just abandoned your whole belief system i mean before i didnt agree with you but at least i respected you how how how are you going to go into work tomorrow how how are you going to face the other science guys how how are you going to face yourself oh that was fun so whos hungry
ok i didnt see it because i was putting on my jacket but i uh want to believe you
uh huh why is that
chandler you called janice thats how much you wanted to be with someone
