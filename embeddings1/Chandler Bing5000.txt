yes please dont spoil all this fun
look ross you gotta understand between us we havent had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento you however have had the love of a woman for four years four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out and that is why we dont do it i dont think that was my point

yeah i think for us kissing is pretty much like an opening act yknow i mean its like the standup comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out
the problem is though after the concerts over no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again yknow i mean were in the car were fighting traffic basically just trying to stay awake
oh i think this is the episode of threes company where theres some kind of misunderstanding
oh uh that would be mine see i wrote a note to myself and then i realised i didnt need it so i balled it up and now i wish i was dead

okay i gotta ask who calls us that
pheebs i dont understand how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about
heyhey i thought naked thursdays was just our thing man
well i like that idea obviously i was thinking maybemaybemaybe it could be a game room yknow i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh like space invaders and asteroids for 200 the real ones the bigbig ones
okay so you mean no as in gee chandler what an interesting idea lets discuss it before we reject it completely
which is why asteroids is perfect its the oldest game
i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away
no im not mocking you or you beautiful guest room
nothing monica and i had a stupid fight
wanted female roommate nonsmoker nonugly nice
hi listen im sorry about before i dont need to have a game room i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldnt get girls and now i can emnow i have you notnot that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way i see women
thats a great idea we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room
we dont have to come up with this now
hey yknow what why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room
yeah i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair
oh thats cool then ill just bring them both over
okay i get it so i get nothing nothing here is mine everything here is yours ill get up in the morning put on your clothes and head off to work
in the game room
all right thats fine thats fine i wont bring over the chairs i wont bring anything over i wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandmas place
you can call off the roommate search hi ill be living here
why did you take the shower curtain down
well why dont you tell her to stop being silly
well we are fond of the silliness but we also have a soft spot for the love
thats laughter
hes being silly because he knows that we enjoy the silliness
yeah im not so worried
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him
oh my god someones killed square man
oh thats so sweet i want to show you something too
yknow those bigbig uh road signs that say merge
yknow so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed because thats you and i together merge
just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go
why dont you open with a joke
wait a minute hold the phone youre not talking about chuckles university
thats the way i did it til i was 19
yes you got something from the screen actors guild
okay its not a check theyre saying your health insurance expired because you didnt work enough last year
im sorry man theres never a good time to stop catching on fire
okay make sure you look both ways before you cross the street
thats great but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now
this sounds like a hernia you have toyouyou go to the doctor
thats a hernia
hey will you grab me a cruller sit down will you go to the hospital
i will loan you the money just go to the hospital and lets just get that thingpushed back in
oh joeys got a really bad hernia but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix
listen im really glad you got the part
but are you sure you can do this
now is that never talking about it again
im sorry heyhey joe why dont you uh lift up your shirt take a look at this kiddo we have a crying child roll the damn cameras
okay let me just jump in and ask at what point did you think this was a successful marriage
ross just for my own piece of mind youre not married to anymore of us are ya
you left a shoe here
oh good when he comes back for his keys ill be sure to give him your shoe
yeah im gonna pass cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies
little baby girl chandler where i have heard that before oh right coach ruben do you know what pheebs when youre done over there we kinda have a situation over here too
see thats where i think that youre wrong weve been playing these babies man for man we should really be playing a zone defense
i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone phoebe you can be in charge of wiping and yknow mon you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around
okay im a rookie i should not be in the end zone
shocking since you still have the keys
what equity investments
you dont even have a car
check it out check it out when the babies wake up they can meet krog
he can do more than that he can destroy the universe
theyre not gonna swallow anything you guys are being way over protective when i was a kid my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass
glass sand whatever
all right i thought about it and maybe youre right maybe krog is not a safe toy
i swallowed the sonic blaster gun
well i was trying to prove that i was right yknow and it turns out i was wrong and now its lodged in my throat
but you found the keys to his clothes
ahh i think it just moved its really poking me
i think thats gum
okay listen this really hurts lets go
well lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours
and protected them from a tornado
was the setting of phoebes triumph
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself
phoebe would you take a look at this mess
okay listen im gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent
first of the month
no just the months you actually want to live here
okay here is the phone bill
thats our phone number now look i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing so why dont i justwhy dont i just cover you for a while
its not charity joe
okay uh heres the electric bill
so well do the rest of the bills later then
no i hope not i tried to offer him some money but he wouldnt take it
i figure that 1500 would cover him for a few months yknow but i have to trick him into taking it so i wont hurt his pride
well that would help the pride thing
hey wow you look great wanna move in with me tomorrow
okay so what do you girls have planned for tonight
well instead of just hanging out we figure wed do nothing
oh nope ii have plans with joey
yes but for the last time
hes at a dinner party
oh i wish id know you were going to do that i ordered chinese
say joe i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night what do you say we play a little uh foosball for money
yes it would what do you say to 50
okay lets play the big game italy vs china apparently
okay give me a chance to win my money back okay sudden death one goal 1000
no no no noone can beat me
see now thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking
still broken
well there are other ways of winning back your money how about a little uh a little blackjack

ill teach ya come on come on its really easy and really really fun
okay here you go i have two queens what do you have
hoho you win 50 dollars
oh yeah okay lets play again what do you got
well thats a full cup
it doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six that my friend is dcup okay now much have you won so far
not 700 exactly
well you see in cups once you get 700 you have to double it
hey i didnt make up the rules now after you receive the doubling bonus you get uh one card now that one card could be worth 100 bringing your total to 1500 dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getno way
whhow did you lose at cups
all right lets play one more hand one more
i cant take the big white dog you love it
no but waitwhat if i bought it from you yknow and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price say 1500
when did i try to give you money
im just trying to help you out okay i wanna make sure that youre okay
no problem roomie
i invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money
its not a real game i made it up

what why did you do that
how could it not matter

no you shno you said you made that up
eh theyre both good i generally just go with monicas drunk again
okay one more time

he took my joke he took it
you know who else picked rachel ross and you know what else ross did he stole my joke you know what im going to get a joke journal yknow and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes

because youre the only one that can be fair
dont try to sway her im your only chance to have a baby okay lets go
okay i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve
can i finish my story
so steve said he had to go to the doctor and steves doctors name is doctor muppy so i said doctor monkey and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up
im not arguing with that
hi oh hi
monica is a selfsufficient together lady being with her has been like being on a vacation and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit
im out of words should i just say the whole thing again
youre a little high maintenance
im sorry youre not easygoing but youre passionate and thats good and when you get upset about the little things i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that and thats good too so they can say that youre high maintenance but its okay because i like  maintaining you
im off the list

richard no one supposed to know about us see i did it again
yeah ill sit down
i got a good one i got a good one i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy
before you say anything have we got a story for you guess who we bumped into at dinner

hey you have to forget about elizabeth i mean if youre not careful you may not get married at all this year
what did you guys just do
richard was there so i couldnt do it
im gonna do it tomorrow yknow andand surprise her but now youve ruined it
who walks into a room and asks to see a persons hands
this is terrible what am i going to do
thats right i can throw her off i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind
i can do that ive had 30 years of practice
okay okay here she comes how do i look do i look like a guy who doesnt want to get married
oh just hanging out talkin about uh websites yeah we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you
yeah well yknow it just got me thinking though why would anybody ever want to get married huh
sure i do in fact i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural i mean look at pigs lets take a second here and look at pigs okay pigs dont mate for life i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports
if marriage worked id be all for it but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is 97
well never say never but yknow probably uh yeah never
whoa whoa whoa what is all this pressure is this some new kind of strategy why dont you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap
its okay i got a plan
i was making a coconut phone with the professor
myoh my god
hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him im supposed to do that
well what yknow what im gonna do im gonna go over there im gonna kick his ass will you help me
okay im gonna get the ring im gonna get the ring im gonna go find her and im just going to propose
where is she im not scared of you
scotch on the rocks with a twist on a coaster haha monica monica

oh my god i cant believe this yknow i thoughti thought you were a good guy
nothing happened nothing so you didnt tell my girlfriend that you love her
yknow what i cant believe this do you know what you did my girlfriend is out there thinking things over you made my girlfriend think
and what does she have to think about i love her
but i am willing to offer her all those things this was just a plan yknow a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things shed be surprised
it was working until you showed up you big tree i mean this isnt fair you had your chance with her you had your chance and you blew it and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other and this is all just been one stupid mistake i was gonna propose tonight
yeah i even got a ring did you get a ring
yknow richardyou are a good guy
i cant talk to you now i gotta find monica
well why didnt you stop her why didnt you just tell her it was a plan
well where where did she go
i cant believe i ruined this
okay okay okay oh god i thought wait a minute ii can do this i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it then i realized the only thing that matters is that you you make me happier than i ever thought i could be and if youll let me i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way monica will you marry me
okay you get her in here you bolt the door ill be in the closet
its okay i want this to be your night too to monica

young youre a manchild okay now go get changed because everybodys ready and please oh please keep my underwear
uhh youve had a lot of sex right
well its just the reason that im asking is because i kind of eh uh i was unable toi mean i really wanted too but i couldnt there huhhmm therethere was an incident
its happened to you

now monica i know youre upset but dont forget there is going to be a wedding you are going to throw the bouquet and then theres going to be a honeymoon maybe in paris
we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la 
then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love not just because its romantic but because i can

oh i dont think i ever heard that story
what a sweet story
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal
i dont know my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding shes saving the rest for her divorce and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to dollywood
honey its gonna be okay
look it really is gonna be okay the important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married
well i have some
well close to
well youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding
well come on ive been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future not just for a party
no i realize that honey but im not gonna spend all of the money on one party
look i understand but i have to put my foot down okay the answer is no
look i thought about it too and im sorry i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding
yeah im putting my foot down yeah look when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then then thats what were gonna do
eh forget about the future and stuff so we only have two kids yknow well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college
uh four a boy twin girls and another boy
well stuff like whered we live yknow like a small place outside the city where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff yknow we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door of course wed have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old
are you kidding okay ill give you a hint ill give you a hint
i got glasses
you didnt think i used to wear glasses right
thats okay pheebs were not having a party or anything so you dont have to get us
what we want honey
dying people say the craziest things
our kids are gonna be fat arent they
hey hows the boat
well its good that you finally have a place to do that
do you know what i was thinkin
nothing i just like to go like this
uh why do you have a lecture

okay we owe you a present
i will tell the story it was going great i let him win we were bonding he even said i could call him dad
daddy all right look heres the story well we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy so i take off my glasses and thats when in happened
why do they put so much steam in there
why okay why whwhwhy did that have to happen
not that big a deal therethere was touching of things
i dont want him to tell this story for years
if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off
all right im off to see your dad
look i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i dont mean his lap and by face i dont mean my ass
so you understand id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened yknow im a littleim a little embarrassed about it
what did you do when they found out
so i guess we wear swimsuits in here
its your mommy its your mommy
that was one of the worse things ever and not just on tv
and say nothing
nononono hey

stick to your side
thats a plane
because its flattering come on monica come on monica

what are you guys like a gang or something
shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29

oh thats great right there can we get some of that over here please there we go
now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more okay then we can put you in bed okay just smile and dont talk to anyone
i think its necessary
well here we are just a bunch of thirty year olds
monica said wedding
do you think you could get through a poem
well whatever it is i hope it involves winking
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life
i think its the dying cat parade
yknow that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said youre half scottish right
why is your family ross
if you listen very carefully i think its celebration by cool and the gang
well i feel like a snack
oh no thanks i dont like any thing from my scottish heritage
well its just my entire family was run out of scotland byvikings anyway lots of bad memories
we heard you play all the way from your apartment
thats not really important right now what is important is while we appreciate the gesture we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding
because we hate them
we have heard you play
you mean the spitter
easy for you to say youll be wearing a veil
you mean the guy who kept staring at your chest
sorry i just dont like the idea of when i say i do hes thinking yeah id do her too
guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us
we are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy and when i say legitimate i mean gay and in control of his saliva
no but horny for monica minister called wanting to know if we were still together
yknow we havent found anybody else
our minister
should we call the spitter
see joe not that thats not grrreat but one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us yknow it can be more personal you can tell stories about us
no not us us
see joe we want you to tell stories but yknow romantic stories nice stories
isnt that what happened with you and the brides maid
and i was a perfect gentleman and i walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight
but then later that night
well i was i was exactly expecting company after 915
well last time i saw him he was heading out the door with the brides maid and a bucket of strawberries so uh youre not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya
well look its been a really emotional time yknow and youve had a lot to drink and youve just got to let that go okay i mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight
you kidding youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms whoa whoa whoa whats going on you and i just made out you and i are making out
but we dont do that
how drunk are you
thats the perfect amount
well i have kissed over four women do you wanna get under the covers
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you
well i think its safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined
joey joey joey jjjoeyjoeyjjoey
hey joe i was just watching a movieee
theyre in my bag over there
uh could you leave me one
no iiim fine
who did you originally want to hook up with
so you came to the room looking for joey did you ever inintend on telling me about this
oh its not important its not important if it wasnt for a brides maid youd be marrying him not me
i dont believe it the most romantic night of my life and im runner up
look there is no way youre doing this wedding now okay
okay its just weird okay i dont want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and monica iii needi dont know what i need i need a walk
it is to me you wanted to sleep with batman and instead you had to settle for robin
hey do you want this scone it came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you
look joe i know you wanted to do the wedding
how can i not be upset okay i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first
when youre marrying us thats what you should say
id love it if you would do it
but those are the words those exact words
yeah we talked and monica made me see that i over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important
so did monica tell you about this great band called the swing kings that were trying to get to play at the wedding
oh since forever i used to go all over town listening to bands
gap commercial so did you book them did you call
do you want me to call
staying out of the way
sure thats one of the great things about being engaged im not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore
so ross how was your date the other night did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet
uh joe when its one oclock in the morning and you dont come by thats okay
really right across the street
whend you meet her
excellent yknow ross met somebody too
hi howd it go
really joe what would you do if you were in rosss situation
so this is nice i wish i didnt have to go believe me but unfortunately i have to oh uh by the way whats the name the girl youre dating
joey got meat sauce on the banister again
but i love swing music
look all i know is when monica and i went to see them we had fun and theres another reason too
well its just while monica and i were dancing to them it wasthe first time i knew thatyou were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with
hi honey im home
why do you another boyfriend in there or something
yknow its funny i started it but now its scary me so could you come out here please
oh you got a wedding dress thats great
well then why cant i see it
okay i promise illill hate it wow youyou lookhideous
yeah thats like the most ugliest dress ive ever seen whwhy do you to return it
oh thats great great thanks but that dress i mean its like yuck its terrible it makes me wanna just rip it right off of you
i thought you were gonna be gone all day
oh totally pull my finger
okay well i think the centerpieces are too big
kinda theyre really big
no no see when i first meet somebody its uh its mostly panic anxiety and a great deal of sweating
sleeping with somebody new anxiety panic and im afraid even more sweating
i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship look for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives
well yeah but now that i know that youre having these thoughts im back to panic anxiety and uh im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink
water water water
yknow imim really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding
yknow i was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
technically we could have sex again what do you think bossy and domineering
thats me come on
well get rid of her obsessive and shrill
i was not staring at her okay i was just listening intently its called being a good conversationalist watch say something
umm so this aunt marilyn isisisis she coming to the wedding
this is so sad i mean i only have like ten pins
yknow i think we should invite them
well this is just sad
well thanks a lot for hookin me up rach i want you to know that i want you to attend our wedding as my guest
well whats the deal with these thesethese look nice
you mean like for award shows
you mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling you are you wearing you look fabulous
okay who wore those
007 this is james bonds tux
oh i have to get married in james bonds tux
oh its not just that i would be englands most powerful weapon jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service a man who fears no one with a license to kill would monica let me wear this
a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head
you cant wear that im wearing the famous tux james bonds tux
soif you wear that youll make mine less special
please dont take away my cool thing please pretty please
look its my wedding day okay if you were getting married i would never do anything to upset you
that was pretty 007
ross is batman
rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman okay batman is so much cooler than james bond
batman has a utility belt
batman has the batmobile
batman has robin we get espn right
actually i dont like martinis
ooh yum
i would but mine doesnt fit the pants are a little tight
well does that mean that youre not going to wearing yours
let me try it on
