Oh! It's on! It's on!
Althea?! What are you doing?!
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
The man's got a point.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
This game is kinda fun.

How about Joey... Pepponi?
I'm not getting into this again!
You're shooting with Althea?!
Ring dammit, ring!

Your boyfriend is so cool.
Yes, money well spent!
That, that's what's stupid.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
To pay for the gym.

I don't have travel insurance.
We've got to do something!
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Ok, how about this ?
It's exactly like it sounds.
What did you guys just do?!

Because I'm gonna play for ya.
Oh, how well you know me...
But I think we should tell her.
How do you know that? How?
Fine! Maybe I will too!
She's just doing her job!
Oh, right, right, shut up.
I never want to leave you again!
I want you to say that you like her!
Hey Joe what's up?
He thought you said gonad.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
This is going in your book?
Beam me up Jesus.
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Okay, we owe you a present.
Is anybody else scared?
What stupid thing did you do?
I paid for those tickets!
Did she go out with him?
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
That was there when I got here.
You're right, this is more fun.
The reason he just said.
Hi! Nice to meet you!

Dude that is so sad.
Man, I gotta get a kid.
Can I finish my story?!
By drowning or...?!
Way to be cool, man.
What if Joey were president?
Is there a puppy here?
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
What are you guys doing together?
That's what they'll call us.
I married Fred Sanford!
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
You're naked in this picture!
Oh, the tears are real.
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
So, is Janine around?
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
You have to pick your moments.
Oh they didn't want to come!
Well that's a full cup!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
It was a car backfire!
No don't I beg of you!
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
You are so great! I love you!
Y'know, that party wasn't bad.

She picked those out too.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Okay. How about in that cabinet?
Did you not understand the story?
No, no, this is the first time.

Oh, we could do this all day.
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
God, I love these fingers...
You mean the lully story?
Who are you going out with?
You don't know. You didn't see it.
I thought your time ran out.
How's your room Rach?
Oh, that was my work laugh.

Oh, so that's what this is for.
It is so good to see you!
Well, I've got a girl in here.

So, we gettin' a fish?
I'm afraid I might just be.
You're definitely scaring here.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Hey, big guy, game time.
And was the curse lifted?

Why is your family Ross?!
Well, like father, like son.
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Well, I, I should go in there.
Okay, look, just do it gently.
You're turning into a woman.
Me! On my computer.
You're a little high maintenance.
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
Oh my God, what's up?!
Not once did we do that.
Which is why you should do it.
I'm sure you're right, but why?
They're still just friends, right?
And a bagel with only...

But, I never left the room!
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?

I've got canned goods.
You had a bachelorette party?!
GET OUT NOW!!
Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
Yes that was a nice place!
So whaddya got there Monica?
Stay out of my freezer!
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Why wouldn't they be happy?
What the hell is going on?!
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Whoa, snowing out there?
I'm not breaking up with her!
And no kissing your neck.

Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Hey! How'd the interview go?
So you're really okay with this?
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
You're turning into a women.
You can't just call Monica's room.
There you go! There you are!
Uh, could you leave me one?
Oh no, you'll have to come.
What've you been up to?
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Uh, yes, yes it is.
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Game's tomorrow night Joe.
The wife says "Hi!".
No! No! Not, Paris.
What are you guys doing out here?
You hear that? We're the guys.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
There has got to be a way!
I'm gettin' my chair back!
Well, those were seals, man.
No, did he hug you?!
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Glass, sand, whatever.
Oh my God, introduce us!
She was not good. Not good.
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
It was a "Wendy's!! "
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Well, so why not go knock?
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Well, what did the police say?
It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating...
Here we go, here we go.
I can't believe the guys missed this.
Well then why can't I see it?
Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
What... did you get me there?
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Where's my seat belt?
Love your condoms my man.
He started mine first!
And this- is my reward!
Well, you-you know what I meant.
You're not gonna need my help?
Do you have my credit card?
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
We are gonna be great parents.
Can I sleep on your couch?
Ooh, let me talk to him!
When have I ever done that?!
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
I'm gonna put on some music.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
You said that to me last week.
But then later that night...
Our guy smells incredible.
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Could there be more Kims?
Well, only if you order stuff.
And then Joey remembered something.
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Doctor Connelly just called.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
I always liked you, Ken.
Ooh! Calm down ...
But you said you were ready too.
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
I know, but just let me say it.
We're teeth people Zack!
oh yes, God yes!!
You did look like an idiot.
Jenny! That is so Jenny!
You know, I think I might just.
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Just act like you belong.
Youre not gonna lose him.
Wow! Just like in the pros.

"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Kori? Kori Weston?
Mm! Night Gar'!
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
WHAT IS IT?!
Bye. Are you still out there?
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
Janice is gonna go away now.
What?! Why does she think that?
Hello! One marriage please!
We don't need to remedy that.
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
I thought I had to make the jokes!
As crazy as soccer?
Wow! Look at them run.
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
But are you sure you can do this?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
I didn't know you had another level.
I'm not going to let you say anything.
Quick! What time is it?!
There are seven?! That's one?
What is the matter with you ?!?
When did that happen to you?!
No freakshow, she's fictional.
And the Knicks rule all.
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
You left a shoe here?!
You totally screwed him over.
I don't know... um, Grease?
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
What does yours say Pheebs?
Paid your phone bill?
Kinda. They're really big.
That new mountain bike?
That was pretty intense huh?
I did pay for half of it.
You went home with the waitress.
Why am I hearing cheering?
Can I give you a present now?
Might wanna try Joseph.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
We're not gonna lose to girls.
mmm That's enough about you!
So you didn't mean any of that?!
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Well then maybe you should take it.
Well it's not Sean Penn.
Stop talkin' to your men.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
I do NOT want this unit!!
All right buddy, way to go!
Hey, you said that without gagging!
If I see him, I'll ask.
Okay, let's play my game now.
The one time they're not home.
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Nope! I can do this all day.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Joey was in a porno movie.
But I love swing music!
I'd love it if you would do it.
I got the time to get to know Julie.
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Well, it still has to go, right?
No. How are ya Paul?
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
They got a breakfast buffet.
Your work makes me sad.
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Yes, you can pass for 19.
How about those three pointers?
Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
There's no back to this couch!
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Well, she... she didn't win...
Oh, well... Maybe we could...
All right, call it in the air.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
See, I told you they don't swim.
Wow, he looks so normal.
: I thought we had them!
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
I quit and you learn what I do?
Shh! Nice to see you again.
I'd like a Google Card.
No! No! No! I can't do that!
So what job did you get Joe?
No, we only went out once.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Ah! The high road...
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Yeah! All right! You go first.
God!! What am I gonna do?!
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Joey, I saw you push him!
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Lets not do that any more.
This game makes no sense!
I love you, St. Valentine.
Who said anything about Christmas?
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
No! We're not borrowing money.
They're in my bag over there.
You mean you didn't get it from this?
Kill me. Kill me now.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
All right, maybe I should call her.
Okay, you ready for the last picture?
I'll look forward to your call.
Did it turn into sand?
And I think Ross is generous too.
So uhh, how's the palace?
Okay, but now see you're crying!
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Please tell me you got the message!
This is the best game ever!!!
Ok, well, this was very special.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
Oh you've got to be kidding me.
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Wow umm, calm down.
Guys guys, check this out.
Your last roommate's kidney?
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Our next cocktail party?
Do either of you have the keys?
Well, did-did you correct him?
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
I wasn't staring. I was leering.
I don't know. Should we try it?
Okay, the old hug and roll.
What we did last night was....
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
There you go! Someone came!
What do we use to split it?
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
I had the exact same conversation.
...and then it got canceled.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
How did you? How? How?
The man is showing brain.
Here we go! Here we go!
My friend's name is Joey.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Man, didn't she like just get here?
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Did you do it on our invitations?!
Why don't you open with a joke?
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Man, that's some bad advice!
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Now you do that, you're on TV.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit.
So you really OK about all this?
And I just want a million dollars!
I didn't know it was a big secret.

Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
There's a forest right outside.
I am strong! I'll show you!
You can always sell your baby.

Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
What do we do? What do we do?
No, no he went for a walk.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
No one was around to hear that?
How is that ever going to happen?!
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Well we...we still hang out.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Yes, every single one of them.
Really? Right across the street?
Oh my God, how did you do that?
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Hey, what did your agent say?
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.

But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Yes, and we're very excited about it.

But, we'll stay here with you.
So uh, which one is mine?
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.

We're notwe're not saying anything.
He's taking off her coat!
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Our guy has great hair.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Wherever! I've got like 20!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
I don't see him. Do you see him?
Just a little bit of sugar.
More so than anything else.
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Either, it makes no difference.
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
You, touching yourself, out!
Fears and Pet Peeves.
How long have we been home?
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
I'm going to need a bigger boat.
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
You want me to wear your panties?
How do you know so much about this?
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Well it's not flexed right now!
Did somebody sign your bra?
I don't think the flash went off.
Here it is! Here it is!
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Have you talked to him lately?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
You wanna see if we still have it?
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
I know, I still am one of these.
Because the kids need new shoes.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Right behind you, big guy!
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
I think we've found our sperm!
Well you did pull his hair.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Have you ever been with a woman?
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Are those my wife's nipples?
He didn't say anything about that to me.
Yeah let's head off to work.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.

That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.

Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
The food there was, was great.

I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Joey, why is your cable out?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Your family name is Tribbiani.
You are a frightening, frightening man.
For an emergency just like this.
No! No! No! I was so careful!
You still can't stand her can you?
You're building a post office?
We don't have to come up with this now.
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Would you please get some rest!
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Oh, well give me the phone then.

Last time I do that, I promise.
Yes, include more people in this.
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
This is the New York Times.

Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
I found a dried up seashores.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
Do I smell essential oils?
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
You look beautiful. Is this new?
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
You really think that is what he meant?
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Tell it to the Time Turtle!
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Apology accepted. Excuse us.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Well I like both eggs equally.
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Woah, woah, that's not pretty!
No, we'd just like to close them.
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
No, come on, you know that's not true.
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
And that's... how... it's done!
Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
He just said, "No strippers."
Not even on page 7?
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Weird world. Your kids?
They got a phone in there, right?
When did I try to give you money?
That was like 5 years ago.
See now it feels like Christmas!
Honey? Leave it to the pros.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
Basically we just feel that he's...
Alright I feel youger already!
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Uhh... Yeah sure. Click!
Something else I might have said?
I used to have that bumper sticker.
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Yes because uh, you look so young.
I could fall asleep at a play.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
More coffee over here, please!
You mean like for award shows?
And now I've picked it up again.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
You don't think I get up when you get up?
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
It means we're holding hands.
Are you actually saying these words?
So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

All right, I'm nine years old.
Where did you hear it from before?
Oh so there can't be any yelling.
The whole thing! Can we go?
We're you just ten seconds later!
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
In a foreign, romantic country...
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers.
Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?

I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
OK, so now we draw cards.
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Look, we can't stay in here forever.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Do you want me to be afraid of you?

Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
That's very funny. We done now?
I got something for her. It's a book!
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
All right! I found one that fits!
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
I've been taking dancing lessons.
She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
In the James Taylor case.
Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
We were playing poker, alright...
Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
You do know that Wham broke up?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Shh! It is a family name!
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
How do you not fall down more?
Yah, I think I broke my hip.
Batman has a utility belt!
Feelings, such strong feelings.
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
You're it! Now run and hide!
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Well that would help the pride thing.
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
All right! Bring it on, you...
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
Did you tell her what we talked about?
No, the baby's out! Look, look!
One of the slots got filled.
You think we're ready for something like that?
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
And lots of kissing your neck.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Are you hugging the door right now.
I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
What, what are you laughing at?
Yes that would have made more sense.
Work people? Nobody told me.
How about the closet by the bathroom?
Those aren't eleven and a half.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
And protected them from a tornado?
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Ya know, the man's got a point.
Love what you've done with the place.
What about things that are already gold?
But what did he mean by rules?
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
What did you do when they found out?
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Could we be more white trash?
Did you like me when we first met?
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Kick save and... denied.
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Well where... Where did she go?
We are switching back, right now!
Because he was looking at her differently.
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Not to mention the cold sores.
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
let ME be a part of this!
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
I can see why that's hard to resist.
So we both finished our vows.
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
You built a fort didn't ya?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
First I was afraid, I was petrified.
That means nothing to me. Come on!
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Where are they? Where are they?
Had the money in the wrong hand.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
You guys ready fore the movies?
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
The key's stuck in the lock.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
What are the odds? What are the odds?
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
And Milton Berle has a...
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
What's the second part of your plan?
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
So I really never get to win anymore?
We really need to take those tests?
Who cares? It's a stupid game.
Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Come on, let me see that smile.
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Ross came in forth and cried!
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
I'm leaning. This is where I lean.
I told you I should not wear this color.
There's another carton right over there.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
So you know this leaves us with...
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
More importantly, was I any good?
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Why to save your dignity my man.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
They said it could be up to a year.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
Funny: Ha-Ha Or Funny
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Her ankle is what you're watching?
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Oh great, food with hair on it.
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
We're on a semi-first name basis.
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
Can you believe how lame this is?
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
You're not even giving them a chance!
What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
There is not one hair on that head.
What's an identical hand twin?
You mean there's more than one of us.
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
I did. But it came at a price.
I would really love it if could do both.
What? What did you take a picture of?
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Okay. 1...2...3-Go! I'm gonna kill myself!
Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Really? In front of all this people?
Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
Could you get us a couple of beers?
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Depends on what you mean by we.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
What size shoes do you wear?
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
We have to assign heads to something.
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
I can't believe she cracked your code!
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
I've had a very long, hard day.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
I didn't know you read tea leaves.
Why would the baby creep me out?
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
What problem did you tell him you had?
We are. He's meeting us here.
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
So they're going on dates? When?
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Alright! Just follow my lead!
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
So uh, what did this woman look like?
See, that's why we don't let her play.
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Air hole! Air hole!!
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Dying people say the craziest things.
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
That's what you say at the end of a date.
So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
Well, this is just as boring in England.
He took my joke, he took it.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
This is the worst bachelor party ever!
I am proud of all my friends today.
Hell is filled with people like you.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
Guess who's back in show business.
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Don't judge me, I'm only human!
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
He's really picky about his patients.
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
You gotta let me slam the door!
Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Is this a service you're providing me?
Would you tell her I let you win please?
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
Why did you look at me when you said that?
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
I think we may have really done it this time.
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
We don't know what could make this go away.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
I wish I had smoked for my career...
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
That guy's going home with a note!
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No, it came out to an even twenty.
David, I'm pretending to read here!!
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Do you really find this attractive on him?
Joey said that you're in here with another man.
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
No, our guy is just a floating head.
It is starting to get dark out there.
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
And look how happy the mom is now!
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
The young hot ball and chain.
Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
I don't think you did a very thorough job!
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
We should always always break up together.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
Those were like the best seats ever.
Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
And you're our age. You're our age.
You tricked me to get me into bed?
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
But you found the keys to his clothes?
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
How about to the street say from the balcony?
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
Oh dear God, there's two of them!
I don't think we've actually done this before!
What does it look like? I'm going home.
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
You are not going to believe what I did today!
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Do not speak ill of the dead.
Who jumps at loud noises!
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
You can be the best man when I get married.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
You put your fist through the wall?
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
It's not a real game! I made it up!
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Well, this does butch it up a bit.
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Give him money? It was a joke!
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
You got waaaay too much free time.
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
It is when you put it together with that one.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Of course I will call you. I love you.
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me.
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
And that's the only colour that comes in.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
You have no trouble telling time now right?
...And then he burst into flames.
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore!
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Were you're parents happy, or something?
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Well, Phoebe I thought I'd--Yeah, what the hell.
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.
Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
I've got five bucks says you can't.
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
To the left, to the left- aww!
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
You may wanna get some more of those too.
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
My God! You must be good in bed!
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
They have that on the napkins at the club.
If it helps, I could slide over.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
Ok. First of all, this is green!
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
OK. Brake left, gas right?
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
All right. Well, I'll check the guest room.
The Sooner State, whatever that is.
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Here, pass these, will ya..
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
So, how many have you sold so far?
I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
And I also got... two more apples.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Course there, they just call it food.
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
Y'know who has a great video camera?
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
All right, let's show them how it's done.
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
Then free as a bird. What's up?
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
So you're never actually going to pay me back?
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Again I must go back to, how?
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
At least as long as I have the pants.
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
The cold weather hurts my hip!
It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.
Hey that's okay. So, where do you want to go?
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
She must've been planning this for years!
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama...
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money...
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
... And where's this money coming from?
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Open up! Open up! Open up!
People who've never ever been to Paris.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class.
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
: What do you need, what do you need?
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
How much did I love The King and I?
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Do you realize you get louder each week?
Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
What does a Wicked Wango card do?
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
One more score to go! You can do it!
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Oh yeah. I'll take, I'll take your picture.
No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
How long it took to go back in the water?
I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.
All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
We came over as soon as we saw.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Come on, he won't even know what they mean.
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?
It kills over one americans every year.
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl.
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Ross! It's got your wavy black lines!
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
Yes! And that's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding.
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
I know it's tough now, but things will get better.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control...
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Oooh that may be a New World's record
Ok honey. that was close. -Cut to Rachel.
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance...
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now.
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath...
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's.
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
As we all are at some point during the day.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
They're terrific, and they live right here in the city.
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Before we go out there I've got a present for ya.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...
My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you-Go to the doctor!
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Weirdest thing. Did I hear--Mother of God it's true!
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed.
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Yeah! Anderson just scored again! There's no Anderson.
I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food...
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Okay. Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Hey! Babe! Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready.
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date...
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! I can't, I can't hear you.
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing.
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out.
I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
You'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning...Don't let Phoebe in.
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .
Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang...
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
Why don't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...
'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume...
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go to your room! You're grounded"?
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Then, I might as well ... do this . Not really sure what to do now.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
I'm sorry, we're just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Oh, And We Should Warn You, Before You Watch It don't watch it.
Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
What?! I didn't even know that-Why didn't you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said...
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Not to shabby, I got this all off myself...using my wife's tools. Oh my God!
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes...
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
I wasn't trying to open your closet! I wasn't trying to open your closet! I swear!
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
If it's not, then there's two of them. And that would mean it's the end of the world!
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
I Understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Joey's gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you'd come by as a slutty nurse.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it.
I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Yes, I distinctly remember 'cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
This is so exciting! It's so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em.
Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
I don't know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
No, honey you're not sick! Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing.
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
The sun'll come out...tomorrow! Bet...your bottom dollar that tomorrow... ...there'll be sun.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Ok, go quick! Ross: Thank you for a delightful stay. Ross: Oh, my maple candy!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
...also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed.
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat.
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Well, if we're gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y'know alphabetically or by genre?
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn.
Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
A Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo. I'm gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
...I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!
Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?
Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
Oh y'know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
'Candy and Cookie'. 'Candy and Cookie?' Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
And I'm the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" "Oh, thank you very much!" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!
Here's a picture of Ross. And that's me. And that's me and Ross. Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, "If it helps!"
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating.
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!
Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a...supple leather lining.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It'll probably be more than a year.
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
It's a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying.
No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Okay. Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights. Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job.
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they don't.
This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance.
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.
And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty words.
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers. No? Really? They taste so good.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Oh hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other.
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine." So you just touch yourself for anything?
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?
Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his "business" partners.
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Maybe we finish this for him! "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo.
You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym who am I kidding pay-per-view porn. -Cuts to Monica.
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel.
No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with...with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need--There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
