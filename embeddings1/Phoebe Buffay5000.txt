ok so this is pretty much whats happened so far ross was in love with rachel since you know forever but every time he tried to tell her something kind of got in the way like cats and italian guys finally chandler was like forget about her but when ross was in china on his dig chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel she was like oh my god so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back but what she didnt know was that ross was getting off the plane with another woman uhoh so thats pretty much everything you need to know but enough about us so howve you been
oh my god this is huge this is bigger than huge this is like all right whats bigger than huge
cause you know if you dont look good we dont look good i love that voice
oh ok how its been so long since youve had sex youre wondering if theyve changed it

ok youre gonna have to not touch my ass
all right ok but but you have to promise that you will not be all like controly and bossy and monica about it
all right now some of you are gonna get cut and some of you arent but i promise none of you are gonna feel a thing
all right thats it i quit
yeah but this isnt the face of a person who trusts a person ok this is the face of a person who you know doesnt trust a person
would you relax i know what i am doing this is how he wears it
well he was a he in arthur and in ten
oh my god im sorry im sorry which ones demi moore
oh shes got gorgeous hair
its too soon to tell shes resting which is a good sign
im not gonna lie to you ross it doesnt look good i put a clip on one side which seems to have stopped the curling
your hair looks too good i think it would upset her ross why dont you come on in
oh yeah oh i can do that
you wanna do it right now

woof woof
oh all right what did i have
oh no wonder i dont feel full

you wont even taste it

oh i tasted bens milk and ross freaked out
come on it doesnt taste bad
you guys um i know that this really doesnt have anything to do with me but um i love you guys too oh i really needed that
you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason
i miss janice though hello chandler bing
ok its very faint but i can still sense him in the building go into the light mr heckles
im sorry but sometimes they need help thats fine go ahead and scoff you know therere a lot of things that i dont believe in but that doesnt mean theyre not true
like crop circles or the bermuda triangle or evolution
nah not really
i dont know its just you knowmonkeys darwin you know its a its a nice story i just think its a little too easy
yeah i just dont buy it
ok dont get me started on gravity
well its not so much that you know like i dont believe in it you know its justi dont know lately i get the feeling that im not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed
just dont look at this funky shirt
really you can actually see it
huh so now the real question is who put those fossils there and why
maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts
look cant we just say that you believe in something and i dont
what is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you no whats that all about i think i think maybe its time you put ross under the microscope
hes even kind of cute
id call that excessive
janice you called janice
uhoh its scary scientist man
ok look before you even start im not denying evolution ok im just saying that its one of the possibilities
ok ross could you just open your mind like this much ok wasnt there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat and up until like what 50 years ago you all thought the atom was the smallest thing until you split it open and this like whole mess of crap came out now are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you cant admit that theres a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this
i cant believe you caved
you just abandoned your whole belief system i mean before i didnt agree with you but at least i respected you how how how are you going to go into work tomorrow how how are you going to face the other science guys how how are you going to face yourself oh that was fun so whos hungry
ok i didnt see it because i was putting on my jacket but i uh want to believe you
uh huh why is that
chandler you called janice thats how much you wanted to be with someone

yeah so i said ok relax please yknow i mean sex can be just about two people right there in the moment yknow its if he wants to see me again he can call and if not thats fine too so after a looooot of talking   i convinced him
ok all right we want to hear everything monica get the wine and unplug the phone rachel does this end well or do we need to get tissues

ooh thats good wow but now if you were pregnant what would you name it hint phoebe

wow big day huh people moving in people getting annulled
hmm something bad to tell rachel bad news for rachel what could that be
ross its not that big a deal so youll been divorced three times youll still have a life youll go on dates
ross youre being ridiculous okay you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces
yknow thats really fair yknow most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60 ross nobody cares about this except you thisthis embarrassment thing is all in your head here ill show you come here
hi hi listen my friend ross is about to be divorced for the third time but wouldnt you date him
okay so what do you think ladies who wouldnt be interested who wouldnt want to date him
okay what about you wouldnt you want a date
whatever what about you meg
she said hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl
well i thought you loved her when youwhen you married her
hey you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani
yes and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her i must say well done bravo meg
so did you get the annulment
i knew it because you love rachel
yeah complicated cause of the love
ive never been more convinced of your love for her
oh we do but not just yet
okay umm well first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way yeah but it wont work out
i know then im gonna marry chandler for the money and youll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids
but then we ditch those two and thats when we get married well have chandlers money and rachels kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachels drinking problem
i dont want to go into the whole thing but umm we have words and i kill him
hey check it out this is unbelievable joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes
well that would be great but then what do we do about denise
yes denise denise
maybe because you never listen to anything that i say i talk about her all the time denise
so what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her
you didnt tell her did you
of course not because youre in love with her
what do you mean comforted her
ahha a classic sign of love the hug
yeah not in your case lovey loverson
okay just tell me this did you or did you not smell her hair
ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head thats why thats why women are shorter so that men will fall in love when they hug them oh come on ross youre a scientist

please i think you know why
come on ross youre a paleontologist dig a little deeper

maybe it was the guy
its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring its a beautiful ring

oh suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects
yeah its totally meant to be tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night
i know robin is so gay
im really glad you guys are okay but i just keep thinking what would happen ifif you two actually had hooked up
oh my god this is a sixhour pill thats it im out of the woods ohh what a relief
oh its like huge weight has been lifted cause look no hair loss not a rash no hives im just so happy because no shortness of breath no temporary euphoriaoh
since when are you into swing music
what is your job
am i crazy or does this totally go
thank you rachel but look at monica
ooh is that spelled with a c or a k oh my god it doesnt matter theyre both great
hey rachel come on
im coming im coming
okay hey what do i do what are you doing did you find the dress
iwe gotta get monica
oh my god excuse me excuse me
i know hand me a tissue
does that mean carcass is available
well just figure out a way to talk him out of it
yeah swing music is so out
yeah but the swing kings yknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsthey just stop living
oh my god im sorry too soon you go
oh my god that guy at the counter is totally checking you out
im just saying get his number just in case but no chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill
i did but that was really fun
oh great we couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck
all i could think of was yknow is he gonna kiss me is he gonna kiss me
im a lady monica i dont kiss and tell but this hickey speaks for itself
i just like him so much that i just feel like ive had 10 drinks today and ive only had six
you sound like a guy
youll have a last kiss
bye we said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love
okay dont sweat it chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system that guys cute
no that is the last thing you want to do
because youre marrying him
all right ive never been engaged and ive never really been married but i can only tell you what my mother told me whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship do not communicate them to your husband
that is correct yes youre supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight
oh my god youre right go go tell chandler hurry before its too late wait no does this also mean putting out doesnt get you love
oh its just so unexpected ii uhboy ill tell you its just such an honor to be nominated for a nobel prize and yknow to win one for a massage especially after having just won a tony award for best actress in
in reservations at 800 by neil simon thankthank you neil thank you for the words

oh somewhere joeys head is exploding
rachel its okay you dont have to do this i believe you all right okay ifif you say that you kissed melissa then you kissed melissa
i just wanted to see what all the fuss was about
yeah except your breasts look kinda small
well maybe you dont talk about your feelings back then maybe you just say something about yknow all the things that hes taught you like or all the things you taught him
well lets just say its shes lucky she has a sweet ass cause shes not so good at the writing
well lets just hope it works yknow nine out of ten marriages end in divorce
yeah youre right hows the mrs
