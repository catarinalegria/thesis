Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Ewwwww!
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
We just got the message.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Yeah.
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Thank you.
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Oh yeah, yeah.
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Nope.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
How?! When?!
Great! Problem solved!
What are these, like famous chickens?
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
What the?!
Um-hmm.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
Damn!
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
Will you quit hoggin' it!
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Let it go, Ross.
Ah, Kate?
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Yes!
Who's birthday party?
Hey! Oh.
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Exactly.
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
I know I would.
Woo-hoo!!
You?! And-and you?!
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Yeah I guess you're right.
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
Hi!
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
You went through my personal property?
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
What?
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
Hey!
Umm?
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Hey.
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Well, what's it called?
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
So he likes to break stuff.
Ooooohh!
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Hey.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Thanks Ross.
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Oh dear God!
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
Transplant.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Hey.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
True story!
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Okay.
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
This is your place?
Okay.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Hey!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
The silk? Feels really good!
Hello!
No, never done that either.
No. What?
Die Hard!!!!!!
But you got to be with both of them, right?
How come the writing is in Spanish?
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Of course!!
Chandler loves marriage!!
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Hey.
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
They didn't fight a lot?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Hey!
What?
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Huh?
What are you guys doing up?
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Oh my!
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
What's up man?
Yeah.
Hey!
Ooh, very official.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Oh, and how is Allison?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Hey Pheebs!
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Good morning.
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Get down!
It's Joey.
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Yeah.
Kristen?
You have Knicks tickets?
Whoa!
Die Hard 2.
Dude! How come you took off?
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Who's seven?
Well, I think we all learned something.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Someone like an...angel?
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Yes!
Yeah.
Hey!
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
Uhh do it?
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Okay!
Sure! Why not?
Yeah.
Woah, dude, burn.
Unless what?
Yes you are!
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
So how you two gettin' along?
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Tribbiani.
Me too, we should get goin'.
I'm not answering that.
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Wow.
And?
Me too.
Okay.
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Hey, Pheebs?
Vomiting stories are funny...
What?
No, can we get back to me?
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Pretty much, yeah.
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Do what?
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
What are you talking about? Keep it!
What?!
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Huh?
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Oh yeah, who's playing?
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
London baby!!
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Chandler!
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
My identical hand twin!
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
No one.
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
All right.
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
It's the Knicks!
Yeah.
G-sharp.
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
So, I guess this is it.
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
That's right!
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Hey!
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
You want his yearbook?
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Then you do. Heh, heh.
Are you really not going?
Uh-huh.
Twice?
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
Sir.
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Hey!!
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Hi!
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
With Carol? Oh.
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
It-it doesn't?
Hey!
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
About what?
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
See, this is a great apartment.
It'll be great for next weekend.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
Yeah! Me too.
Do you know something?
Hey!
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
Don't come out here!
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Heh... I was bluffing.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Wow!
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Erin.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
That's...kinda hot.
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Althea!
Miracle!
Hey!
Yeah, that's her.
What are you doing?
Is everything okay?
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Hi!
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
She's gone.
Is something wrong?
It is.
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Tequila!!
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
That was one good minute!
Maybe she never got your message.
Feminine.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Don't do it!
Oh, OK.
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
You're getting a cat?
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Come on baby, come on!
Oh, "you do, do you"?
I can hear you!
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
Where you going?
Oh no-no-no-no!
So, you're just Bing?
You wanna make it 6?!
Okay.
No more jam?!
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
Right, I go-, I got it.
Yeah. Yeah.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
What?
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
He's fine!
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Anybody want a croan.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Huh.
What-But you saw the show!
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Okay, bye-bye.
Hey.
All right, we'll start with...apples.
Well don't just say.
One.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
I know!
Psss, that is whack!
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Oh.
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
You just give him a spoon baby!
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Wait a minute.
What?
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Uh.
Ok.
Pick me!!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Ah.
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Argh!
Hey!
Charity.
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Every night!!
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Lean-lean-lean!
Okay.
: That book got me through some tough times.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
So what're you going to do?
I gotta get one, too.
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Mmmm. Good.
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Uhh, 11!
Oh yeah.
What?!! That's even worse!!
What's the matter with Rog?
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
You wanna smell him?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
What? No-no it's her birthday!
Wow! Cool!
Yeah, what' going on?
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Hi!
Oh, you weren't finished?
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
It certainly is a miracle.
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
What?
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Cat.
Ah, the stalker.
I finished my book.
Picture? What picture?
See, now it's weird again.
I know!
YES!!
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Beth, Beth dies?
I know, Monica told me.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Okay.
Okay, great.
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
And you'll be topless?
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Good for you!
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
We dare.
Yeah I did!
Yeah.
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
All right, how about the ladybugs?
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Yeah, all right.
Oh yeah!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Uh, 10:30.
Ooh, that bad, huh?
What the heck is that?
Wait up!
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Who?
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Oh my, would you look at that!
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Oh no, what happened?
Yeah!
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Hey.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Yeah.
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
Saw a girl with that vest.
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Oh, not my parrot.
I know.
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
I just had a glass.
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Nooooo.
Damnit Carl!
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Great! Thanks.
Ohhh!
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Ahhh...... Eh?
Weekend at Bernie's.
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Hey!
Alright open your eyes.
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Why are you doing this?
I think I'm gonna cry!
Hey!
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Hey!
Yeah, we look great together.
I am... free!
You got all that from saline solution?
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Hey! Any good mail?
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Take it back?
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
That's weird!
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
That's great. Thanks Rach.
What?
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
They did it right there on the couch.
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Then you're not invited.
Yeah that dog left!
That's not what she said last night.
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Waiting for candy.
I can't watch this.
Hola, amigos!
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Is ah, is Chandler around?
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Yeah!
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
So?
Shhhh!
Says who? Your mom?
Hey!
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Okay! All right!
What are you doing?
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Seriously?
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
Freaky.
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
PBS Telethon.
But, I love you.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
I didn't know it was an auction!
No, my first fan mail.
You guys are messin' with me, right?
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
Yeah. What are we getting?
It's okay, these things happen.
Sperm or regular?
What?
Hey! Is the show still on?
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
It's him, not it!
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
No.
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
No you're not! Not to me!
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
"When can you move in?"
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
This is crazy.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
"...by doin' it."
Hi!
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
This will just be my batch.
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Mary-Angela.
Hey.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Oh umm, not go.
Pheebs!!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Hello.
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Oh, you should here me.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
See ya!
Is that the fire alarm?
Hey!
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
I don't want to move again!
Yeah, I know.
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
A monkey.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Tell us!
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
In a minute!!
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Hey!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
You wanna eat? My treat!
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
What?
Okay, fine.
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
What? Me having a job?
They're here already?
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Really?
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Well?!
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Way to be strong, man!
Well, first it's not a purse.
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
Or?
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Hey, Kate!
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
She was kidding about that right?
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
Yeah
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
...I'm his
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Hey uh, what's a matter?
'My scones.'
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
How do I look?
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Hey.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
What?
Wh-why?
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Aw, I know all about Kip!
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Oh I am!
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Thank you.
If anything should happen to him...
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Yes!
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Okay. Okay.
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Great!
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Oh.
....yeah... what else?
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
Hey Rach.
Awful! Horrible!
Done.
Like what?
OK.
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Hey! He beat ya.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Bastard!
Maybe you changed?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Really?
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
Yeah.
Hey!
All right.
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Dah!!
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Cool.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
Great scene yeah?
Are you thinking about Monica?
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Hey!
How do you mean?
Nothing. No, nothing.
Hey, what's up?
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
Uh, hang out?! How long?
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Well maybe I love ya'.
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Okay.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
I'm not finished.
...Yeah?
What do you need?
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Thank you.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
All right. I can't see.
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Hi.
Wouldn't she?
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
What is with your nose?
Yeah, what's that about?
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
A little foos?
And she's back in the game.
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Yeah, okay.
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Okay...
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
How do you figure?
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
They were in his office.
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Yes.
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Good luck. And I'm still right!
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Do you want me to learn?!
Hey.
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Have you been here all night?
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Booo!!
Look, it was a job all right?
The fruit roll up.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Uhh....
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
I'm not Drake.
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
What?!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
Ross? You okay?
Something like that?
Oh, classy.
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Hey!
Which, is the new plan!
Hey, Pheebs!
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
WHOAA!!
Yeah.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
Great! Roomie!
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Alright, now you say something.
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Iced tea.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Wow!!
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Hi!
Yes!
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Now, don't argue with me...
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Hey.
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Yeah.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hello.
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
Oh my God!
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
No.
Okay!
You okay man?
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Hmm, noodle soup.
No. Why?
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
My folks.
Your other student, was you!
Pheebs!
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
What are you in love with her or something?
Stegosaurus!
All right!
Sure is.
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Ahh!
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
That's true.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
What?
Okay! When?!
I don't wanna.
Sure! It flushes it.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Y'miss it?
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Erin! Still here!
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
Umm, well, what else could it be?
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Yeah baby!
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Why?
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Do you have any respect for your body?
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
I don't know.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Yeah!
Oh!
I will not take this abuse.
You could say that.
Hey.
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Hold on, you-you knew?
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
We're 29, we're not women.
And deaf!
All right. Good deal.
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Okay. See?! I told ya!
Hey, you guys!
She's right in there.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Uhh, they're tall.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Blah?!
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.

Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Hey!!
Hey, hey, hey no.
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Why don't we just go on two.
Ohh, get these things out of me!
So I guess you all saw it.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
We should really learn how to play the real way.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
So where you gettin' it?
What?
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Well, hey I did learn.
I have never known love like this.
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Yeah!!
Where's all the tissues?!
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Shut up!
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
You call that delicious?
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
I bet it was about her a little.
Sorry Phoebe.
All right, Ross!
All right!
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Yeah.
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Whoa!
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Mine!
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Hey guys.
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
No.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
What are you doing?
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Chandler? A word.
No.
It may not be a bed of roses.
No, only for sex.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Cool!!
No! Drums!
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
No.
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
Why not?
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
He paid a lot of money for it.
Think it'll work?
Y-sure!
My god, Angela.
No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Really? I don't...
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Hey! What's up?
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Hey.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
What?
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
Sounds nice.
Okay, all right.
Where've you been?
That's right!
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Yes! And the table is mine.
That's a two line part.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Come on man, really how old?!
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
You?
Yeah? What did ya have?
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
What-what-what is so funny?
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
That's crazy.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Looks good, uh?
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
Thank you.
A woman in a man's body.
Hey!
No you won't.
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Yeah you do!
Oh my God.
Hey!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
When's that?
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
Aww, you guys are so cute!
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Well, let me see.
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Let me get that. You got five bucks?
Oh well then, good night!
What's ready?
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
No, seriously.
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
So, so, what'd ya think?
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
That's nice.
Hey.
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Hey, you're back too!
The what?
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Yeah.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Hey!
Yeah! Yeah!
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Wow, it's really long.
Who?
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
What?!! That's even worse!!
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Cool.
Come on!
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Was his name Angus?
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Okay.
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
No!
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Anybody gonna eat that?
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
You got all that from the back of her head?
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
The Red Ross! Okay.
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
Ohh great!!!
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Hey man, what's up?
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
What do you mean?
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Hey.
Good luck Phoebs.
Havin' some trouble?
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Oh my God!!
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
WHAT?!!
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Dude, they're not objects.
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Big fat goalie.
What you do mean?
Ahoy!
Hey, here she comes.
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
....Are we still talking about sex?
All right! So, was it amazing?
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
All right.
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Are you naked in there?
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
I didn't get it.
She was nothing compared to you.
Hey.
Oh yeah, that's right!
You're right! That did cheer me up!
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
After!!
Hey!
Phoebe?
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
Glass of fat?
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Nah.
Yeah, so.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Come on!!
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Chandler's wearing panties.
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Our place, the hall! I...
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Okay, shoot.
Hey-hey, check out the hat!
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Hey.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Hey, let's go look at it!
Yeah!
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
By someone besides Monica?
Hey!
No, we're alright.
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Ahh, you drive safe.
Those two only had each other!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
A little salami.
Hey.
Hey, how was your chef thing?
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Why would he turn off the TV?
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Hey! How's it going?
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
What?!
Aww, there we go.
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Congratulations.
Dark red.
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Holden McGroin.
Hey.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
What the hell is that?!!
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Oh!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Gotcha.
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Put your hands together.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
See you in 2003.
I'm so sorry.
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Porsche.
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
I can't believe you're not picking me.
What?!
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Hey!
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Because it's faster.
Tongue?
Oh. What?
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Oh! Oh!
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Come on!
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah? That's so nice!
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Hey.
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Really? To what?
You knew about that?
Sure.
Hey! It's Porsche!!
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Hey, thank you so much.
Okay. I'm in.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Yeah, okay.
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
You got it.
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Damnit!! Did you move?!
Monica and Rachel made out.
No. No.
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
I say push her down the stairs.
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Well then, do it better!
Hey.
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Nooo!
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
What is it?
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
Ugh.
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
I gotta get the before shot!
So, we're having fun, right?
Right this is staging.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
I can't tell you what I know.
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Open the box!!
Good enough to get fired.
Services? Oh, services.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Fine.
And you feel like we hold you back.
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
What?
Oh, what did I say?
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Nooo, later.
Hello, Zelda.
Yeah?
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Both of us?
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Ahh!
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
Hey!
What's in it?
Hey!
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Merry Christmas!!
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Well, you know Chandler.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
I call Godfather!
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Excellent.
No, but he's...
Let's see what else he'll do!
You really think so?
I can give it a shot.
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Maybe that's the problem.
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Yeah.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
You're smoking again?!
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
You don't drink.
So you're the gynaecologist?
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Spock's birth control.
Thanks man.
Your chair?!
You see this, this is a friend.
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
We don't make enough fun of you already?
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Hey!
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Hey!
Umm, hi.
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
You want my advice?
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Yeah.
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Thanks.
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
What else?
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Joey.
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Well we'll see!
So are guys doing okay?
Dude you said, "No!"
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Y'know what?
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Morning, Paul.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Good for you!!
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Sh-shh-shh!
Are you ok, Ross?
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
What's the matter Ross?
What?
Oh, just had a baby.
YOU KNOW!!!!
Seven hundred bucks!
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Yeah!
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
Argh!
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Hey.
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Not following you.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
What? What?
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
So what's it gonna be?
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Yeah, where the hell is he?
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
No, that means nothin to me.
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Hey!
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
What are you mad at me for?!
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
It's me, Joey!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
My Giant? I love that movie!
No.
Ohh great!! Hello.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Great!
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
You'd better act surprised.
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yeah! Once.
What?!
Yeah, he likes porn.
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
I'm sorry, do I know you?
The country?
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
No.
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Chandler?
Hey!
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
Yeah.
Yeah right!
That one will.
I'm comin' out!
Hello?
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
And what did he say?
Let's ride.
Chandler?
What is this? Fruit?
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Movies?
He-he-eyy.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Yep.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Joey!
Hey! What's going on?
Well, that's really a different question.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Ah whatever!
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
What message?
Okay.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Oh-ho, yeah!
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Vulva?
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
I think Saturday-.
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Hey!
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Hey!
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
They're brother and sister!!!
Check this out. Can I have this?
Okay.
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
Huh? Uh...
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Yeah! Come on.
Can we please turn this off?
Ah.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Face to face, yeah!
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
'Cause it's a television show.
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from...
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
Hey.
Hey guys!
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Hello.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
We all hate Emily!
Is it back in the cage?
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Very good! Okay. G.
No. Why?
What happened? What happened?
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Umm...
Well, that went well. Yeah.
It's not a cat!
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Yeah!
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Ok.
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Many are scheduled to appear.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Pastrami.
What a phony.
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Hey Pheebs?
Hey-hey-hey!
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!

I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Ooh!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
Uh, moist, yeah.
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Women are mean!!!
Hi.
I don't think so.
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
That's Fergie baby!!
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Hey.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Ohhhh man
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Don't answer that.
With a man?
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
But it really...
Uh...Cookie?
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
You won't boss me around anymore?
Come on look guys, don't fight.
Well, she graduated from high school!
What?
I-I-I-I did?
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Well, how-how come?
Really?
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
What up?!
What?
A swimmer!
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Hi! How are the Gellers?
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Yeah! That guy's all right!
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Okay.
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
So, there was no miracle?!
Okay, may I see the comics?
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
You're not gonna like it.
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Rach, these are for you.
We did it!!
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Heyyy.
Howdy partner!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
I think you're right.
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Marcel?
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
You can't go out there.
Oooh, what you got there?
Nice move.
I was afraid of that.
Yeah, did I fool ya?
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Hey!
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
A four and a nine.
What's this?
Eh! There you go.
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Well, the duck...
It is???
So what are you gonna do?
Why not?
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Ohh.
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
What happened to the foosball?
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Whoa!
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Really?
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
No ma'am.
No we weren't!
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Oh my god.
