Hey!
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
You spit on me man!
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Why not?
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Women are mean!!!
What about Game 1 of the Series?
No, I really have to pee.
Hello!
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Suck-fest.
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
C'mon, she's your mom!
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Hey.
Wow! This girl is good.
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Yeah!
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Arrrghh!!
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
What?
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
What?
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
What are you in love with her or something?
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Yeah.
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Nooo!
That's not what she said last night.
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
I'm still on the set!
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Hey!
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
I know! That's why they trashed me!
My chair heels itself.
Hey.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Saw a girl with that vest.
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
You?! And-and you?!
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Nothing, why?
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
What?!
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
Ooh, I like that.
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Oh-oh!
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Okay.
See ya tomorrow!
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Oh!
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Wow! Sure! That's great!
What, like there's a rule or something?
No.
Damnit Carl!
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Hey!
No! I won't leave you!
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Yes! And the table is mine.
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Hey Estelle, listen...
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
I know I would.
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
I finished my book.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
I don't know! But it's the same!
Why not?
I call Monica's room!
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
What's he doin' in my section?
That's a two line part.
You think I need a new walk?
As in Rosita does not move.
Ross!
Hey!
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
No.
Hey-hey!
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Hey!
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
I don't know.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
She's still asleep.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Hey!
Ahhh...... Eh?
I gotta get the before shot!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Alright, now you say something.
Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Me too.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Yeah.
So, we're having fun, right?
"...by doin' it."
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
What?!
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
H-h-h-how's the duck?
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
What message?
: That book got me through some tough times.
Yep.
So are guys doing okay?
No. Why?
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Right!
I can hear you!
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Joey!
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
That was one good minute!
Ah, are you okay?
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Okay, you're on.
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Hey!
No!
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
You guys don't think I look 19?
What's goin' on?
What? What?
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Oh my, would you look at that!
Oh yeah, that's right!
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
I don't know how to play Cups.
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Oh dear God, let me think.
Yes!
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Aww. Ohh!
Alan.
Like what?
It's cute, huh?
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
How do you mean?
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
How do you mean?
Sure, neighbor come on in.
Good.
All right. I can't see.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
...I'm his
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
Yeah! Once.
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
What?!
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Hey.
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Why not?!
No-no.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Hey-hey, check out the hat!
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
I can scratch that right off.
Done.
Pheebs! Sorry!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Fifty-six!
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
'Cause it's a television show.
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
All right.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
You're gonna have to pee on it.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
No!
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
No, we're alright.
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Better?
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
Everyday use.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
No!
I'll take it back tomorrow.
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Open the box!!
The bigger half.
Yeah!
Damn! I am good at Cups!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
That sounds perfect!
Yeah, well...
Oh yeah...
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Sorry, that was wax.
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Thank God! I'm exhausted!
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Yeah, what's that like?
Thank you.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
I know.
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Let me see that!
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Hey!
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
PBS Telethon.
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
What?
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
It's the Knicks!
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
You seen Sandy?
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Oh, it's perfect!
Ohhhh man
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Thanks man.
There y'go, kids.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Yeah, whatever.
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Well, may I ask for one example?
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Very good! Okay. G.
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
No, look.
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
You're kidding!
What?
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Well, first it's not a purse.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
I am... free!
Dawson?!
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Ah.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
Let me get that. You got five bucks?
Is he gonna be ok?
They're gonna do it together.
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Seriously?
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
All right, let's get me back up there!
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
No.
You guys okay?
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Many are scheduled to appear.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Yeah baby!
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
That's nice.
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
You call that delicious?
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Well I didn't tell them!
Yeah.
Who knows?
How far'd ya get?
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Uhh, they're tall.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Hey.
Monica and Rachel made out.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Anybody want a croan.
Yeah!
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Uh, wow, 700.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Oh, OK.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
I think face to face.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
This man is my God.
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
She laughed at you?
Ah.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Hey!
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
No, never done that either.
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
No.
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Check out the rack on this chick!
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Wow thanks!
Wow! Didn't know that.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
What?
Yes you are!
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Yeah well we should order some food then.
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Still not hot enough!
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Ross, you need some help?
What is this? Fruit?
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Yeah.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Really?! Well, when?
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
Okay! How you doin'?
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
You bet! What's the part?
Good luck Phoebs.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
That's right, I have a phone in here.
Really?
And you'll be nice?
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Hey!
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
You want my advice?
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Check.
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
OK.
I need something sweet.
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Nice!
It's creamier.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Nothing. No, nothing.
Ooh!
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
Uh, boat rope.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Well, back to square one.
I think Saturday-.
If he goes first he can!
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Picture? What picture?
I'm listening.
Oh my!
Huh?
Like what?
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Really?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Oh, okay. The what?
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Yeah, you do!
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
You could say that.
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
Shut up!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Yeah!
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Naa, she's lyin'.
Shut up!
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
I'll see you at 8:00.
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Hey!
Why not?
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
..Naughty!
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Oh.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Hey!
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
Now, don't argue with me...
Out.
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Are you naked in there?
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
I know, here-here!!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
I don't know how to lead.
Ross!
He-he-eyy.
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Put your hands together.
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
You don't drink.
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
It's not that far! Just drop!
Yeah I did!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
What?
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
No problem. Hey Chandler
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Okay.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
What?
Both of us?
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
How good is that?
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
We'll just see.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Oww! Big ring!
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
What's the rush? What?
Does it have to be a whole day?
Hi, Lauren.
Um-hmm.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Do you want me to learn?!
Oh, I do. How you doin?
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Hi!
What?
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
Hey!!
Oh... Yeah, you do.
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
That you're actually 50?
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Says who? Your mom?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Not from where I was standin.
Wow!
Hello?
Hey Jessica.
Take it back?
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
It's not what you think, that was...
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
This is Janice.
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Oh.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
You're fake laughing too, right?
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
All right.
So you're the gynaecologist?
Well, where was I?
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Hey, all right!
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Merry Christmas!!
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
Okay, good to see you again.
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
Really? To what?
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
How?! When?!
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Charity.
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
Anyone mind if I save this?
Say it... say it!
Yep, that's my audition.
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Freaky.
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
I slept with Monica.
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Hey, how you doin'?
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
You went through my personal property?
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Hey.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Not me.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
What?! What?!! What is it?!
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
Hey, you guys!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Hey.
Hey.
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Can I ask you something?
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Yeah I'll take that.
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Well that's how I feel.
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
Die Hard 2.
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
Hey.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
What 'cha doing?
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
And you feel like we hold you back.
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
What happened? What happened?
I know. Ross is getting married.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Was the chord at least right...
Pheebs?
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Are you thinking about Monica?
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Joey Tribbiani.
You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
She told us.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Bye-bye!
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
What?
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
All right.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
I've got a science question.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Okay. See you guys later.
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
So, you and Angela, huh?
Do we need a cake?
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Hey.
That's the rule.
Ohhh, here it comes.
Hey no problem.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
All right!
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
And deaf!
That's right!
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
Yep!
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Okay, great.
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
Oh, just had a baby.
Huh.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
My mom will.
Oooh, what you got there?
Great nap.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
All right, but in the future...
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Thank you so much.
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Can you believe this place?
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
All right!
Good enough to get fired.
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Damn!
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Done.
Yeah!
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Hey!
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
This is amazing.
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Thanks.
Hard to say.
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Just pull on it.
Y'know, about what happened with us.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
Phoebe?
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
You do?
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
Ooooohh!
Sure! Why not?
Hey, the fight's starting!
Ok.
Yeah.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
I might know something.
Hey! Hey!!
I know! Neither did I!
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Woah, dude, burn.
Five years.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
North route!
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
Right this is staging.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Nope, not that one.
Okay!
Hey you guys! What's happening?
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Hello.
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
When's that?
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
So I guess it's Joey then!
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
YOU KNOW!!!!
Nope.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Ah-ha!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Or an uncle...
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Oh, and how is Allison?
Who's Rick?
Dude!
This is it! This is my category.
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
She keeps punching me.
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
What's the game?! What's the game?!
I'll never get to be a best man!
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
All right. Good deal.
Okay!
Thank you.
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Wow! This looks great!
Wait, wait, wait!
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Did I get it?
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Definitely!
Ma! What're you doing here?
How're you doing?
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Yeah!
Oh right, right.
Don't answer that.
Hey!
No, but I'm gonna!
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
Uh, does it hurt?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Okay.
You're kidding right?
Yeah.
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Oh, Chandler.
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yeah?
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Well he made Rachel cry!
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Nooo.
She really said that?
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
Yeah.
Awful! Horrible!
What?
What?!?!
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Now? You want me to go over there now?
That makes sense!
Heh, what d'ya say?
-Peaches?
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Come on, quite yankin' me.
Hey!
Sure! It flushes it.
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
Oh yeah, no problem.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Thanks.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Hi!
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Okay, shoot.
Aww, there we go.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
What a phony.
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
I wanna gooooooo!
So I can do it?
No, I don't think so.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Really?
What?
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
No, seriously.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Hey.
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
They were in his office.
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
Is that your card?
Oh.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
"...when I look back over our time together..."
I don't believe this!
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
We could climb Mt. Everest!
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Hey!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
I know!
I look more like him than you do!
I don't know Rach.
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Hey I-
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
Umm, hi.
That's right!
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Yeah, I was bummed too.
Hey!
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
No you won't.
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
You're getting a cat?
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
Okay.
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
What?!
Hey!
Wh-why?
Hey Chandler!
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Hey!
Hey.
What is the big deal?
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
Hey!
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
Or?
Are you serious?!
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Stegosaurus!
Okay, may I see the comics?
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Awwww!
Whoa.
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Why not?! I'm hungry.
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
That's not funny at all!
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Hey!
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Really?
That's us.
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Call it even?
Right. No big deal.
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
What was it?
Hey Rach.
Yeah!!
Really?!
What kind of smell?
So, I guess this is it.
What?
Hey!
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Hey.
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
No way! It's mine!!
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
That'll be $3.85.
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
Hey!
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
Interesting.
Oh, I will.
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
C'mon, Ross!
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
What?
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Hey.
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
You just give him a spoon baby!
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Hey, here she comes.
What are you doing?
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Yeah! That guy's all right!
Hey!
What?!! No I'm not!!
Hi!
Huh?!
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
How ya doin'?
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Hey.
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
So, there was no miracle?!
Oh, classy.
I'll take it!
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Yep.
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
I Gotcha!!
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Sorry.
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Okay.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
All right, I'll see you guys.
I know.
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
So you uh, still wondering?
Yeah, big stuff.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
No I won't.
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Was his name Angus?
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Me too.
You're right! That did cheer me up!
Let's get out of here.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Chandler? A word.
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
So what's it gonna be?
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
It's uh, right through there.
It's not a cat!
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
I'm not listening to you!
Okay.
Weekend at Bernie's.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
What's going on?
He should take the sack?
Hi.
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Wha-
Alrightalrightalright. There.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Yes.
Okay.
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
That was good beer.
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
You can't go out there.
Look, what do you want me to say?
Ahh, yes.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
That makes more sense.
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Exactly.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Eh! There you go.
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
Hey, what time is it?
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Yeah, what-what's going on?
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
You want to see her again, right?
Yeah baby! No baby!
Really?!
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Think it'll work?
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Sure! What's up?
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
They did it right there on the couch.
I'm him.
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
That's right.
No.
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Yeah?! So's yours!
What?!
Heh... I was bluffing.
Hey.
What?
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Ok.
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Hey!
Luck!
Hey!
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
Shhhh!
Get out of here, really?!
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
But, he loves Emily?
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Okay, the last thing...
No-no, thank you.
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Hey, you're back!
It certainly is a miracle.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
You kissed my girlfriend!
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
He's planning your birthday party.
4:30.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
But what about how much taller he is than me?
So, I hear you're single now...
Lifeguards.
Come, come here.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Vulva?
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Nana?
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
Chandler!
Cool, thanks.
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
Yes!
Why, are you moving out?
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Hey!
Hey.
Hey, Felicity.
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
How?! When?!
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
What?!
Do you have any respect for your body?
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Did you call the cops?
You wanna eat? My treat!
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
What?!! That's even worse!!
I guess.
Argh!
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
We didn't ruin it!
Done with the bookcase!
Are you strippers?
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
So uh, how you doin'?
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Nah.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Hey!
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Ohh, get these things out of me!
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
I don't know! Charity?
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
In the box.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Hi!
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
Joey.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Hey Terry!
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
Yeah.
Ewwwww!
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Hey!
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
You want his yearbook?
Yeah.
Glove salesman!
Our place, the hall! I...
Hey. It happened!
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Hey, let's go look at it!
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
Hey you guys.
Ohh, I love birds.
Hey Gunther.
That's what it says.
What?!!
Okay!
I was thinking Chinese food.
Yes!
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Yeah you did.
Oh hi!
Didn't think so.
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
You look good.
It's All Relative.
London baby!!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
But it really...
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
What's in it?
Bye.
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
I-I-I-I did?
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Here, I got five, I got five.
I'm a man.
So, does that mean the audition is off?
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Your other student, was you!
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Because they wanted me to audition!
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Wait up!
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
It's never gonna happen.
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Get out!!
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
I can't watch this.
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Good luck. And I'm still right!
Yeah, I know.
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Oh-ho, and mine!
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
She was kidding about that right?
Oh, yeah, I do.
What's the matter, Pheebs?
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Well, what's it called?
Oh well then, good night!
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
No more jam?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Who?
Uhhhh.
I don't want to marry Chandler!
My god, Angela.
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Well, the duck...
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Hey!
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
All right! So, was it amazing?
Yeah, he likes porn.
No I didn't.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
What, what is it?
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Oh noo...
Guess what?
Shut-out!!
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
What's the matter?!
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Hey! So I'm back.
Look, you wanna use our place?
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Fine! Get out!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
All right, I guess this will be fine.
What award are you practicing for?
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Yeah, that's her.
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Huh?
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
You can't do anything!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
How was your conference?
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
It's never gonna happen.
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
You do, thanks.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Mmmm. Good.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Yeah! Come on.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
So, so how did it happen?
Why are you taking this away from me?
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
G-sharp.
Yeah, they're not coming.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
You're one to talk.
Morning.
The Irish gig guy?!
With a man?
When do you think we lost her?
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Hey.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
WHAT?!!
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
Oh! That's nice.
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Huh.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
No, can we get back to me?
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
Damnit Carl!
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Oh my God.
What party?
That's because all people are selfish.
Yes!
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Yeah!
All right! But, you do it with me once.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
Oh, how bad is it?
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Got it! So...
Cool!!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Ascot!
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Yeah!
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Ahh!
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
You're not gonna like it.
Yeah, all of us! All day!
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
That's right, $2,000.
Why?
Yeah, did I fool ya?
Nice!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Hey!
Hey, here you go.
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
I know! They suck!!
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Some girl ate Monica.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
Oh, you weren't finished?
Why?
Bye, Pheebs!
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
Okay!
Uhh, rub it?
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
You know what the. . .
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Do we have to know about that?
What?
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Waiting for candy.
They know you know.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Great, you can cover Chandler.
The silk? Feels really good!
Yeah. Bijan for men?
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
3, 2,
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Oh, well I'm uh...
Ohhh.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Will you quit hoggin' it!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Yeah, what's that about?
Somebody help me out here!
Who-ah-ho.
I found my identical hand twin!
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Cool.
What picture?!
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Hey! What's up?
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
What do you got there?
Y'okay, Phoebe?
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Yeah.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
All right.
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Hey Mon!
Well then maybe I will.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
They loved me!
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Hey!
I don't know.
Those two only had each other!
I can't tell you that, no.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
No.
You're driving me crazy with that!
It may not be a bed of roses.
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
We did?
I don't know! But it's the same!
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Duh, where've you been?
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Where's all the tissues?!
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Done!
Congratulations.
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Takes it out of you?
Bye-bye.
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Yeah.
Okay, great!
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Have you been here all night?
Home is Home Star stew.
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
I can give it a shot.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Dude, you soooo need this car.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
You meant sex, right?
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
I call Godfather!
Hey, what's up?
Urse...
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
I got it! Here we go.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
You and me, next dance?
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
London baby!
All right, huddle up, right over here.
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Well I didn't tell them!
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
That's crazy.
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Who?
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Are you going to do it?
What you do mean?
I know, Monica told me.
I don't want to, I'm scared.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Sure. So how long you been...
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
Hey!
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
We dare.
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
He's doin' some thinkin'!
Oh, well great.
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Uh, moist, yeah.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Oh, no!
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
Hang up, hang up.
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
Okay. Okay.
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
What are you guys doing up?
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
What do you need?
All right! Hey-hey!
You're in!
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Feminine.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
It'll be great for next weekend.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Cookie, now you can punch him!
She's not crazy is she?
That's what you told me.
It does in mine!
Die Hard!!!!!!
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
What's ready?
All right.
No! Drums!
Good morning.
A woman in a man's body.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
WHOAA!!
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Hi!
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
Not a problem.
Animals dressed as humans.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
What is it?
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
What?! Tonight?!
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Ooh, something hurts!
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Aww crap!
The Ice Capades?
Right, I go-, I got it.
You have Knicks tickets?
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Which what?
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
Hi!
Who wants French toast?
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
What?
No, only for sex.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
