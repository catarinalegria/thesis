So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
What?
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Uh-huh, that one!
And you?
Oh, is everything in the car?
But I didn't.
Watch the thorns!
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
We have a baby?
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Phoebe!
Then why are you laughing?
1250.
Ohh!
