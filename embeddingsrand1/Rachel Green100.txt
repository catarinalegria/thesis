Really?
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Yeah?
Right.
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Coffee.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
What?!
Jeez!
Good bye!
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
I've never wanted you more.
Hey. Got a second?
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Well that too. Joey?
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Yeah.
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
We ended up having sex in his chair.
I did not!
Oh.
Was she good?
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Small...
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Do you want my pickle?
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Oh come on Ross!!
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Sorry.
Okay. I'll miss you.
That sounds great.
Hi!
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
And you were at this job for four years?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Hey!
Oh, hi!
No! Nothing!
Okay.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Four.
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
It's really not that big!
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Hi.
You?
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
That's....
Yeah!
Oh, this one's for me!
Thank you.
Are you kidding?!
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
That's weird.
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
And you know Monica and Ross!
Allll done!
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
But, but?
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
I promise.
How have you never been on Oprah?
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
You're just staring into space.
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
God I'm just a horrible person.
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
With Ross and Jill?
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
