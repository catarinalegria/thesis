Hi!
No. A break from us.
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Oh yeah.
Left.
Ooohhhh!!
Ben just said hi.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
Well, it's my cat.
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Goodnight.
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Oh.
Sophie sit!!
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Hey, guys, what's up.
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Ohh, that is soo sad.
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Okay! All right! How was she?
Hi!
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
What are you doing?
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Okay.
I didn't know you could get married here.
Hey, Monica!
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Yes!
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
So....
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Oh my god.
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
I went really long.
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
I know.
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
Hi!
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
Just once!
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
What?
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
What the hell was that?!
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Great.
So now what have we agreed?
At his apartment. Is this juice?
I'll be out in a second.
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Yeah.
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Okay.
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Ugh!
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Okay.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Which one do you think she is?
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
Okay.
Hi!
You know what?
Does it?
Oh, Ross...
Fine, I will.
I'm sorry, let her?
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
What?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Really? Mine too.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Yeah, he broke those too.
You know what?
