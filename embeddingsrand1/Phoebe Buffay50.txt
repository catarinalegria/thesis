Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
What?!
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Ohh.
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Did you find the dress?
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
No! Barry and Mindy.
Well, I can't help you.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Yeah, come to papa.
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
I thought you meant in life.
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Hello.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Are you serious?!
Oh, was I doing it again?
The coins have finally forgiven me!
That's right.
Oh good!
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Don't get me started on that.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
