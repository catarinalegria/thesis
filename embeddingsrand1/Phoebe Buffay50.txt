Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
I think it's important that you do.
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
You have your birth certificate?
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
G'night, bro.
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
Shh! Get me out of here.
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
Oh hey!
So now, what is this now?
What?
Fine. All right, fine.
Yes? Yes! Oh.
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
I love it!!
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Yeah?
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
You're not going?
Thank y...
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Ooh.
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
All right.
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Okey-doke.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Okay. See?
Stay.
What?!
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Yeah, I don't need it.
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
