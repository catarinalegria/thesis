Monica said wedding.
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Oop!
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Really?!
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Good luck!
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Hey.
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Okay.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Is it on?
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
That new mountain bike?
Congratulations!
Hey.
Okay. What was tonight?
You built a fort didn't ya?
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Hey!
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
We still have porn.
Phoebe.
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
But we don't know the neighbors.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
