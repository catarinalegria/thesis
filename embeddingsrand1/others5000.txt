Nobody! We put them in here!
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Good-bye! Good luck!
Neither of us like Ross!
Hi!
What?
Oh that's so great!
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Well, somebody got some last night.
I don't think so.
What?
No help required Chico.
Hello?
No, pretty much just a towel.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Yeah! Yeah, we can!
Chandler?
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
No one likes a buttmunch.
You didn't!
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
How does it happen?
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Okay! See you later!
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
That won't be necessary.
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
It was, wasn't it?
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Now get on out of here, you!
What's with you?
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
What?
Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
I love you sweetheart.
C'MON!
Did I put too much rum in here?
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
You did!
Hello Skidmark.
Excuse me?
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Where are they?
Six dollars, please.
Of course! It's her favorite.
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Y'know it's ironic...
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
No, it's-it's Andrew.
I'm a little embarrassed.
Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
My joke wasn't funny.
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Do you?
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Yes.
Ohhh.
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
For Chandler!
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Oh, yeah! Right!
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Very tasteful.
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
Drops. Here, they're free.
Joey!
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
Oh, it's you.
Um, now. Phoebs.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
Rachel didn't you just light that?
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
Someone in there?
Here you go.
Sorry.
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
It looks like her.
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
Are you serious?
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
Yeah.
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
OK.
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
I'll see you.
Yes.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Can I help you?
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
Nobody. I was just practicing.
You may kiss the bride.
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
Monica bang!
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
Great. I'll see you later!
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
Five oh dollars.
Um, leave.
Also Monday.
I guess he doesn't know.
Uh, ow.
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
So. How'd you guys meet?
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
Aren't you with that girl over there?
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
All right. I'll get my bag.
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Oh, I spilled some.
I'm here!
Or I'll call you!
What?!
She what?!
Yeah, sure.
Plate?
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
This?
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Yeah-yeah.
I remember when we first got engaged.
Joey!
You can have it!
Adios.
In the park?
My God, what were you thinking about?
I love your car.
Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
And who may I say is calling?
Yeah, we are.
Somebody lose a ring?
Well I just thought...
Rachel's coming up the path. Doesn't she look pretty. Jack...
Ohh, brisk tonight.
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
I have a little comb.
I want you to move in with me.
You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
What?
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
Hi.
I feel great. In fact! What?
Aaaaahhh!!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
Come on!
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
You okay, kiddo?
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
Which do I like?
So oysters, huh?
Tag Jones.
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Hey! How's Ben?
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
I'll help you dial.
Take thee Ross...
I'll be there.
I didn't realize that she was so close.
Well, this has been fun.
Three, Two, One!
Five more seconds.
You don't think I'm cute?
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
I'm not coming back.
Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Why?
Y-, y-, you like that show?
I am Julio.
Hey.
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
My job!
What's going on over here?
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
Oh, I totally agree.
No, I was working on my pottery.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Chandler!
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Wait!
Alright, I'll call you.
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Can I help you?
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
Come on in.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
You two were married?!
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
Bye dad.
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
Ohh!!
As were you.
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
Hello!
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
Kristen.
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
No problem.
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
That's really a day shoe.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
Just aim for the bump.
We're back on.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Sharing is good.
Yes. They're insanely white.
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
We should?
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
G'night.
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
Whenever you're ready.
Ohhhh!
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
Nope.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
What happened son?
You have no idea who I am, do you.
Hey.
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Lemonade? You ok man?
So ask me what I did today.
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
How you doin'?
It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
Here you go honey!
It's Erica.
What?
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Done!
Yeah, you're funny.
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
You wear bi-focals?
I think we've seen enough!
Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
All right, let's move on.
Even if he were... cornered?
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
It's really nice to see you again.
Sure.
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
This almost never happens!
Mockolate.
What does that mean?
Hi!
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Ok.
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Okay.
Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
The other us.
Oh, okay, I get it.
You mean they're lovers.
Yeah. Hate him.
Umm, is Tag here?
Great.
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
Chandler?
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
You must be so happy!
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
Oh! God! Wow!
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
Oh, say no more!
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
Uhh...Shall I go on?
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
I!
Our little boy is getting married.
Yeah, but this is
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
Chandler?
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
Yeah.
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Why would you think that?
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
I'm sorry?
I will flip you for it.
Oh, hello Ross!
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
Wow!
You slept with another woman?
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
Caitlin!
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Really?!
Ok.
Hi!
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Thanks.
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
Joey, this is awkward part.
I'll go.
Hi Chandler!
I am so attracted to him right now.
Crap!!
Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Hi!
Yes.
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Uh--
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
C'mon.
I don't know.
What?
I'm already here.
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Why are your eyes so white?
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
Oh, that's great.
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Just those two!
I'm sorry.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
All right, man!!
You are so adorable.
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Making out in your office.
This is really hard for me to say.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
Just do it.
It doesn't say that in the script.
No.
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
I'm not freaking out.
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..

Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
I'm gonna work on that.
I am so sorry.
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
How are you?
Alright!
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
Okay.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Both of you?
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Yay!!
I'm talkin'!
Maybe I should go!
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
How, how is this my fault?
Um, would you like to come in?
Okay.
Still no luck.
'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch...
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
It-it's really heavy.
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Gotcha.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Hey.
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Yes!
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
That you and daddy were not on a break.
All of them.
No. No, that's- that's okay.
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
Who is it?
Oh.
I'm with Hamilton!
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Yeah! Punch him!!
We never get smacked.
Sure.
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
So am I!
Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
No, we just went out.
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Hey guys!
Hey, you listen.
Well, it's kinda dangerous.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
See.
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Good luck!
Dance with him.
I know! It's awful. I love you.
Neat.
Op.
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
It's the Gellers!
Oh, don't worry about it.
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
I don't need any toner.
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Girls, sit down.
France sucks!
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Oh.
Behind you?
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
You are an idiot. .
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
A real doctor?
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Why not?!
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
Oww!!
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
Yeah!
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
That's not all.
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
Then don't break in!!
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
Si.
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
Well, not just for you.
Yeah, sure.
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
I talk in my sleep.
Joey!
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Yes I did.
Well, they don't have to know that...
You OK?
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Oh, we're not together.
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
That's good. Very good!
Hi Rachel!
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
My parents are dead.
All right!!
What is it?
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
What?
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
Sure.
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
Hey Pheebs!
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
All right.
How's it gonna be all right?!
Oh! You know what I need?
First of all, it's on your ass.
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
What's that?
Bye-bye.
He is? Why?
Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
Right, why do you keep saying that?
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
So uh, here's your office set!
Really?
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
Goodbye.
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Fair enough.
I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Is that my ass?
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Yeah! Oh my God!
You told me I was the only one.
Stop it!
That was me.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
What do you think?
What woman?!
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Who are you?!
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Wine?
Have a seat son. Hey!!
No.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
You're a big scrud.
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
Okay. Will you marry me?
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
Just give me a chance too...
Joey!
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
You asked him too?!
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Are you all right?
I'll never forget you Hans.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
He's getting married tomorrow right?
Not me.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Salad.
Okay.
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
Ok, yeah.
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
I've never seen it!
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
What?
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
Monica! Where are you from?
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
Thanks a million.
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
Why? What you'd do?
I'm not on the list!
Is that supposed to be me?
Who?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
You're dying?!
Cut.
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
Hi Rachel.
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
Yes you did! What was it?
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
How do you know?
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Professor Geller?
Yeah! Yes!
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
Honey, it isn't good luck.
Yes, you said that.
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Oh, Jack.
So, Monica, what do you do?
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Why the Post?
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Are those your teeth??
That's so great for you guys!
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Ross.
Okay, now I've really have to go!
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
One, two, three...
Okay, I'll do it.
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
That's me.
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
SURPRISE!!!
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
She passed away.
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
Cool! I'll catch up!
Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
Good to see you again!
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
You put your balloons down!!
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
She's not much of a phone person.
That's terrible! I'm sorry!
Flexible hours.
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
And wait, I've got something for you.
Doctor Ross Geller.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Honey, you are in it.
Oh, that's attractive.
Oh yes, there you are.
Ohh, it's a bit small.
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
It was my quarter!
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
It went under the table.
Ahh.
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
Bye! See you later!
This couch belongs to us.
What's wrong?
Yeah, I gotta go.
You did it twice?
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
You're our third call tonight.
Bye Phoebe.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Okay, so it's a date.
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
...from the syphilis.
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
Shut up!
Bye Phoebe.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Three.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
So, would you like any dessert?
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Surprise.
My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Um-hmm.
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
What are you doing?
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
Joey.
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
No! I did!
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
I miss you already!!
Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
You are!
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
No, it was. It was very very good.
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
You got it.
Oh my God, I'm late.
Ohh!!
I say, punch him Joey.
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
You're scratching. Give me the dice.
Ohh, Ross, please!
Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Hi!
And some biscottie cookies.
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
It wasn't my decision!
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
How would you like to pay?
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
...says $30 Father; same as in town.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
I heard that.
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
Sure.
You too.
Wow!
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
Hey, you.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Hi Monica.
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
When is Santa coming?
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
Um-hmm.
Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
I thought it was toner.
Really?
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
What?
Oh my God!
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
Good. Bye!
Really?!
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Mar-gha.
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
Oh!
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Are you sure?
You were gonna propose?
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
I want you Drake.
Hi.
Hello.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Professor Geller?
Let it go, Ross.
Hi.
When's your birthday?
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
Hey, where's his thing?
Who's they?
That's my monkey.
"You have two new messages."
Oh.
There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
And for you?
No, I'm not.
So what are you guys out doing today?
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
Oh!
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Well, here it is.
I thought it was... quite tasty.
You look very pretty today.
Y'know what? We need to move on.
We get high.
Wow! Thanks!
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Hello.
Surprise!!!
Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.
I sure did!
Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
Oh good.
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
C'mere, Patti.
Minsk. It's in Russia.
Hi.
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
Call me.
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
I gotta go.
And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
You're right. Of course you're right.
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
Perfection?
Fine, whatever.
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
Yeah.
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Oh God!
I'm so sorry!
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
Okay!
Got it!
Sorry, members only.
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
Hey! That's my car.
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
Yeah?
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Ok, you really want me out?
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
You're not wearing the patch yet.
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
Thanks.
Eh.
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Joey...
Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
What?
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
Please, can't you help me out?
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
Did you bring the toe?
Her name's Debra.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Hi Ralph.
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
I'm so happy that you're here.
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
This does.
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
If you want it to be.
Yeah, I'm her date.
Absolutely!
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
Yeah, me too.
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Thank you so much for coming.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Your eyes are very pretty.
Oh.
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
So.
Well yeah!!
Bye.
Bing! That's a great name.
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Why not?
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
We're baack!
I'd love an ice water.
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
Dance with your father.
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Hey.
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
It's laminated!
No.
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
I'm OK
God bless the chickpea.
See ya.
Bye!
I will go for that drink.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
Hello Tilly.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
Huh?
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
So how did everything go?
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
You were saying?
Hello.
Hello, Rachel.
I like Ben.
Good choice.
Uh, plate?
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
Oh my God!!
When's my daddy coming back?
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Hey guys!
Nice uh, costume.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
What 'cha doing?
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
What?
Kinda.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
Y!
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Tonight. What are you doing?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
It's open! Come in!
You used to be my babysitter.
Hi.
You don't like puppies?
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
I like her. She sees smart.
Oh, thanks.
Sure.
We'll go to a hotel.
Really?
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?

You got married again.
Hi. I'm Monica.
Rachel.
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
You are so fired.
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
What?!
That's where you pick up the bag.
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
Oh.
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Well, we were very young when we had her.
Okay.
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
Here's the thing.
Oh, you forgot?
Still rolling, annnnd action!
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Your messages have been erased.
I had a really nice time tonight.
No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
Hi.
Hello. Hello.
Hello! Who's in there?
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
Hey Chandler?
Sure!
1...2...
Uhh, you said there was a party.
This is a glaucoma test.
No, it's too soon for you guys.
Rachel is my girlfriend.
Hey!
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
No kidding.
Joey!
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Hey!
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
I can't believe this!
Why?!
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
He better go on for what I'm paying.
Damnit!
You have me!
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
Uh-huh!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
See you later Rach.
I guess you can.
I don't think I should say.
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
Well of course I am!
Hey.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
Who told you that?
Bye.
Definitely.
That's pretty much it.
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
What?
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Looks good. I'll take it.
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Nooo, it wasn't.
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
Hey.
The one with "Heston" on it.
Like this.
Coffee.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
Right.
He told on us?
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know.
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
No. No, you're not a loser.
Hi, I'm Maria.
Oh, well I thought that ah...
And what will that be on the side of?
Wait a minute!
Where can I wash up?
So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
I'm Amanda.
Santa's mad at me.
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Okay.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
You were amazing out there.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Say something..... hot.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
Yeah, OK.
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Oh, Liam.
Uh-oh...
Yeah?
No! It don't go up on the wall!
I guess we just keep dancing.
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
You don't need to fill these silences.
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
What.
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
Chandler!
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
You're look for laughable...
Who?!
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
Hey!
Oh, look at that.
I know. I hate that!
Cleveland.
Yeah?
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
Hi.
Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
Hey, Joey.
What?
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
That's kinda sad.
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
Very busy.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
No, but it did! Didn't it?!
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
No, go ahead.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought.
And for you sir?
Dudes.
Is that true miss?
I'm gonna try.
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
You?
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Julia..
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
Yeah, they're out of town.
I'm sorry.
All right, on the table.
Oh, you're welcome.
Rachel?
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
Phoebe?
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
Oh, me too.
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
You're saying, my wife is in you?
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
Okay.
What?
Uhh....
Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Saw your head. Saw your head.
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Thank goodness.
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
Thanks.
You're strict.
No.
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
Hey!
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
Surprise.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
You told on us?
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
Somebody called about a monkey?
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
What?! Why?
Nope! That never happened to me!
Hi Ben!
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Because I-I like you.
So who made her queen of the world?
Susan! Hi!
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
You're so sweet!
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
No you answer it and take pledges.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Well,... thanks.
Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Are you wearing my glasses?
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
What?
I am Guru Saj.
Don't touch him!
Hey!
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
I'll remember that.
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Oh, boy, do they suck.
Professor Geller?
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Oh?
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
Who is this?
Oh yeah, aww!
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
Can I get you some coffee?
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
I know.
Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
A little.
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
Oh!!
Great!
Sorry, it's not.
What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
What?
Where do I know you from?
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
I'll just throw them out.
Eh.
Ohh, it's time to go.
Yeah?
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Okayyy!
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
It's a...
Your not doing it.
Hi.
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
Ah, which ever is closest.
Hey.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
But you're not bald.
Yes?
No, no!
Ok.
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so...
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
Gary.
Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
14.
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
So? Huh? What do you think?
Hi!
Joey, bravo!
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Worth a shot, huh?
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Gay!
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Well that's wonderful. . . I
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
You are so bad!
I'm ready!
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
She's supposed to be with you.
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
No.
We're outta here!
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
Hey Monica, it's Chip.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
It's a different building.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
He's... new.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Shut the book!
I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Ross, I love you!
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Hi!
I could have cats.
We stopped at the gift shop.
Hi, Julie!
You, you want, you want me to move out?
Hi!
No no no. Talk... dirty.
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
Wow.
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
Yes it does.
Scotch.
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
Hey you guys!
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
Hey what?
Yeah.
Okay.
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Great. That would be fine.
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
Are you gonna play?
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
She's not a twinkie.
It's textbook.
Yeah.
Ah, just one other thing.
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
We're just friends.
How can I help you?
Oh God help me.
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
Doctors are wrong all the time.
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
Oh.
What?
Okay.
Oh crap!
Great!
I'm pregnant.
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
Yeah.
What?
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
Yeah, we're gonna go.
So how did you know I was even here?
So, so, did you hear?
Do you two know each other?
Really?!
So.
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
Monana?
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Why should we?
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
You lost 13 million dollars.
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or...
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Oh no! Oh no!
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
L!
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
Hey guys.
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
You too sweethart!
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
What? Is it my breath?
I'm sorry, I do that.
Wait, just a second.
It's Alan.
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
Tuesday.
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
What kinda noise?
All right, you have yourself a deal.
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...

Oh, well that's not so crazy.
Hi!
Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Rachel?
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so...
What?
Hi Chandler!
So long, Vic!
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
What did you say?!
Thanks. You want it?
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
But Phoebe...
What's up?
This should be fun.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
That's funny. Who are they?
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
Isn't!
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Hey!
Where are we?
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
I'm kidding!
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
Rachel! Could I have a moment?
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Oh yeah, of course you don't!
What's up?
Waitressing?
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Call me.
Kristen.
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Yeah!
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
What?!
Not.... helping!
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Who is it?
Pizza delivery!
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
No, you can't use your watch.
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
You wanna go down to the office right now?
That's it. That's my whole name.
Great.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Hey.
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
What're you doing?
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
Nope.
Next.
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
Dude!
I can promise not to tell her again.
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Well it's gone.
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
M-Me again?
Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
Hi! What's going on?
Woooo hoooo!!!
COME ON!!!!
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
Come on. I'll let you lead.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Hi.
Really?
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
What's it look like?
Come on along and listen to...
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Please, please take him too.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Yeah?
Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and...
Grazie.
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
Well she said she had to think things over.
What?!
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
I can't do that.
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Really? Well, in that case...
What's with this guy?
Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Hey!
So?
Hey.
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
They all had a thing for him.
Yeah, um, may we help you?
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
What?
Bon giorno tutti!
Whoa!!
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Are you?!
Everybody!!
One more chance Ursula, please?
It's Pam.
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
Ohhh! Put it out!
You have three nipples?
Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Ready to go?
Night Mon. Night Julio.
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
What?!!
The pizza-place across the street any good?
What?
Yes! Yes! You did!
1...2...3!
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
Ms. Waltham?
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
Hey Rachel!
Nice to meet you too.
Then uh, what's-what's this?
I think we have an answer.
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Hey!
Oh, no!! No, no!
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
How are we gonna get out of that one?
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
I really can't slap you.
Sure.
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
Well that wasn't easy.
Well, was there anything else?!
Sign here.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
Just call me Paul.
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
Surprise!
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Really.
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Are you all right?
Breakfast is near!
I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
You by the door. In or out?
No! They did!
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Uh, sure, why not.
Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Chandler Bing?
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
Hey, hold on a second.
What?
Phoebe?
What?!
Bye.
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Thanks for dinner last night.
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
Cool! I-I'll see you then.
Hey. I was...
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
And?
Yes.
Oh my God, Phoebe.
Why would we be freaked?
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
Yeah!
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
So we can go out again?
8,600.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Hey, be right there.
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
I want you right here, right now.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
No, just a salad will be fine.
Yeah.
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
Not really.
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
What do you see? What do you see?
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
All those things I said about not being ready...
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Hi.
I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
No! Come on!
I hate you!!
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
Um-hmm.
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
That saves us a conversation.
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
You don't have it anymore?
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Yes.
What a nice story!
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
Yeah, she was my best teacher.
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
No! Sam Waterston!
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
Really, y'think so? I don't..
What are you doing here?
Why?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Monica bang!
...the lullabye of...
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
Hi, Lauren.
Ohhh.
But you know what might really cheer me up?
A test?!!
Impressive.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
I had them made special.
Oh, umm, all right.
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Rach! Come on! Rach!
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Really?
Two years.
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
Okay.
So, thank you for the delicious dinner.
Action!
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
That was...so good.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Ciao, bela.
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Hey!
Bye.
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
No, she'll yell at me again.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
Hi Kim.
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Of course I do.
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Pizza delivery.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
What did he say?
Phoebs.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
Right.
Then we agree?
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Sophie, get in here!
Who is it?
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Shhh.
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
Hey!
Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Phoebe's got another job, right?
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
Hey!
What do we got there?
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
Yeah!
For what?
So Ross, what your problem?
Very, very bad.
Yes, yes, do go on.
I'll check the kitchen floors.
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Sorry.
Hi.
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Let it be me! Let it be me!
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
Ohh. Like what?
Push, push!
Oh sure. Vince?!
Oh my God, Rachel!
No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
You got a problem with that?
As much as he needs.
Come on.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Bye.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?
Okay. I'll miss you.
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
...of course you can kick his ass son.
Hey Rachel.
Hey, waiter.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
...and live forever as a machine!
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
Joey!!!
Normally, I would not do it.
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Morning.
Is everything all right, dear?
Everything.
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oooh it's getting close!
No way!
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
No, I think it's cute.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
Well, I could cut it.
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Hi.
Oh Joey!
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
Oh hello, Ross.
Would ya care to venture one?
M!
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
Wait! Hold on! Hi!
Checking to see if it's even.
Bye.
No.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
Well, my nose got lonely.
Who's next?
I just, I thought Joey was there.
MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
I have nothing to do with casting.
Hi!
May I see your boarding pass?
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
Oh, we have our babies.
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
Thanks!
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Just keep smiling.
No.
I am Father Kalebasous.
Come on over here, sweetheart.
That's okay.
Jack.
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Why aren't you at home in bed?
Okay!
Hey!
Why?
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Oh my God, I'm married!
Yes. Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!
I don't want you taking that thing.
Yeah, but you didn't.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
It's raining men!
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Uh, the dog.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
-make the decision-
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
...No, we hate him.
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Really? I'm a hero.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Really? Then why are you like that?
Ross, I'm gonna go.
Sure!
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Hi, Monica.
Yeah.
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
Hi.
So, all right.
Uh, is your name Chandler?
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
Hope! Hope!
You're good. You're good!
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
On your back... Mom.
I came to give you this and this.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
But, you left the chair area.
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
But they're not here yet!
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less...
Okay.
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Well that's ambitious.
Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Dr. Geller!
Ahh, are you hadsome.
We can't do that.
Uh-huh.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
Thanks.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
I've literally never been this happy.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
What is, honey?
I-I do though.
No! I went with Mindy.
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Hello darling.
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Definitely her.
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Hi.
I'll be right back.
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
No, let me finish.
How's it going?
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
Can't wait.
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
I just hope...
Oh, I got it.
Oh Drake.
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
Judy, the kids..
He told me in person.
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Huuh.
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
Yeah, well..
Guess who?
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
Oooh!
What?!
No, you don't.
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Oh, no.
No, that was clenching.
So I was wondering....
Ohh, so cute.
Alright, we'll share.
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Well...
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
We're still on this side of the door.
What?!
Exactly.
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
Nooo!!
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
Hi!
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
When's your birthday?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Hey.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
What is going on?
Oh. They don't.
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
Oh my!
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
Thank you.
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
Or so I would have you believe.
Come on.
I'm kidding.
Yay!
Count faster.
My husband.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Thanks.
Here's my binoculars.
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
Hey!
Oh, you know what?
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
Were you following me?
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Hi, its us.
I'm Gail.
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
What?
But you're not.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Hey guys.
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
Do you?
Its a little complicated.
Yes, I am.
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Tell me everything.
All right. This is the kitchen.
No.
Hello all!
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
What is this place?
That's fine.
What four of us?
Good morning!
I really like waking up with you.
Hi Kim.
Sorry.
Hey!
Rachel stop!
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
How to make the next one even shorter?
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Let's do this alright.
C'mon, this is us.
How did you know we were here?
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
It really says that?!
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
Oh my God!
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
What does he look like?
But you're not. Okay, good.
No way!
Hi!
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
What in the name of hell?
Yeah.
Oh, my, god.
Well, thanks for the books.
Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
Really?
Well y'know, he's got access.
Me too.
Hi!
We've only known each other for six weeks!
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
You owe me a waffle.
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Okay. I'll be right back.
Oh! Okay! Phew!
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Hey!
So am I!
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
Take 36 is up!
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
That's sweet. Could I take her?
What about the duck?
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Alright. What's the message?
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
That's my wife!!! Get out!
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
No. Why?
I wasn't ready for it.
I can't!!
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
I finally got my band!
What?
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
That might be fun.
Well I'm sorry.
What about Julie?
Wow.
Yes?
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Oh. Good to see you guys.
Hey!
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
Any progress?
My God! You love me!
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
I don't know, it's just...
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
It's good to see you.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
I-I'll call ya.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Of course I do.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
And Rog.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
You had sex with her didn't you?
Hi.
Oh, come on! Come on!
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Good morning Rachel.
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
Oh my God!
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
Hey Ross!
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
Nice car!
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
You're an excellent patient!
Why? Are we done for the day?
Oh!... Right!
I'm not all right.
Move!
Uhh, yeah.
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
No.
Is this guy great or what?
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
Charlotte who?
I think that's fair.
All right.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
You are mad!
Well then we'll get wet.
You have?
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
Fight.
Uh.
Bye.
You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
You're table's ready sir.
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
What?
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
I'm 16.
Who are you?
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Hmm.
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
Whaddyou mean?
I got an extra one. You want this?
So, how ya doin?
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Bye.
Oh my God! It didn't remind you of...
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
So? I mean have you thought about it?
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Hey! I missed you.
Wait! Where's my shoes?
I own this store.
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Do it again!
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
You probably want us to move in together?
What do you see?
No, they're-they're all true.
Sure, I'd like that.
...and this guy...
Hey guys! Hey!
She got a job in L.A.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
In the moment, yeah.
Oh my God, Phoebe.
Oh, hi Rachel.
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
I'll talk to her.
Like what?
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Please, let me do something.
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Right! But, I am sorry.
Yeah, we'll see!
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
Where's Buddy?
So you wanna get some dinner?
I'll get it.
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
Thank you.
Oh, god.
Yes I am.
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
Yeah?
Oh?
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Don't, I like it dirty.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
So, what's up?
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Cut!
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
There you go.
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
What?!
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
Kitten?
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
So what's your name?
Sure.
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Happy birthday.
She didn't.
Tell me about it!
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
So ah, we on for tomorrow?
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
Hey Danny.
Nobody sees the king!
And cut!
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
I beg your pardon?
Oh-no-no-no-no....
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
You thought I was Rachel?
Okay, I love you.
Ross, they are killing you out there!
Yeah. How 'bout that.
What?
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
Yeah. All right.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?
Become a drama critic!
Okay.
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
C'mon kid, let's go.
Hey!
Oh! Oh, God!
I knew it, wow!!
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
No.
Okay.
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
Okay.
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
I just had sex.
Was it her quarter?
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
I'm sorry?
Ginger.
Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Oh well, I'm divorced.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
What?
He started it!
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
No, it really should be burgundy.
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
Could you guys help me?
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
Looks like it.
We'll go to a hotel.
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
You need these books.
Get out!
Someone in here.
Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
For all the free food you gave away.
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Awwwwwwww.
And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
You're in this picture?
Just ah...
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
Yeah, I know, I.
Of course!
Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
Yes.
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
See what you did.
Happy birthday sweetpea.
Oh, I never could do it.
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Okay.
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
No!
Goodbye Geller.
Oh, just updating the phonebook.
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
Oh Drake.
How are you?
All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
Um, I'm not.
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Good luck, babe.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
Yeah. So how have you been doing?
Monica bang!
Horrible!
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
It's a curling iron.
Red Barbra?
Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
And could I get my ring back?
Gotcha!!
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
Okay.
Hey.
Mmm.
What are you guys doing?!
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
What?
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
Really? About what?
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
Hi-hi Joey.
Oh cool! You made him cry!
Fruitflies?
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
You have some life here, sweetie.
Hi Ross.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
Hi Frank.
Yeah. Frank.
Yeah!
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Ohhhhhh!
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
Why?
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Yes! Phoebe.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
I'm the supply manager.
No, I mean happy.
Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Is all this true?
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
Well, my goodness, what was that?
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
Wait!
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
Really?
Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Hi!
No no no! Federal regulations!
No Santa? Was I bad?
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Hey, buddy.
It's not here.
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
Hi.
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Yeah, it sure does.
What about my friend Victor?
Oh my God!
Oh my god.
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
The one in the director's chair.
Monica, you asked the question.
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
This hummus is great.
I know that.
Step aside, ladies!
I'll join you.
That I was not expecting.
You may kiss the bride.
God! Ross!
I don't think so dear.
So this is it? Victor?
Yeah! Right!
C'mere, Patti.
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
So... they sss-still seem normal.
Yeah! That would be great!
Ah here, we brought wine.
Hi.
You too.
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
What, look back?
So! How's the library?
I'm afraid so.
What can I say? She nailed it.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
Well, if you don't, I will.
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
Thanks daddy.
Joanna passed away last night.
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
We don't need any toner.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Who's party is it?
Hey.
That was great, the kids loved you.
But you're not anymore!
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Uhh-huh.
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
Oh great!
It is off. Right Ross?
Ohh. Ouch.
No.
It was fine.
It's lovely to meet you.
Oh-no.
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
With a K.
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
Really. What?
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you're surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
That's Hanson.
Bye.
So, this was uh, really fun.
What about Benitez?
Ew, this feels very weird.
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
Where you goin'?
They have parasites?
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Why are you so jealous of me?
What?
That's exactly what my dad used to say!
Christmas.
Why?
Are they here yet?
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
I, I don't know.
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Hey.
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
Oh.... my.... God.
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
OK, everyone gather up.
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
That's right.
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
Hi.
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
Oh yes, there you are.
Everybody has to audition.
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
How are you?
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
Kate?
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Hhhhiiiii.
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Who's doing shots?
There y'go. Ross?
I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
A film in Guadalajara!
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
I know what your problem is.
Umm, no.
What?
Ok, just one more point.
There is no father.
He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
The Waltham Residence.
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Think she got fired at Riffs?
Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.
Wow! That would be great.
You're an Aquarius, huh?
I brought you something.
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
October 25th.
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
Phoebe Buffay?!
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
May I see it?
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Well of course not, but you were very good.
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
Rachel.
I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
I bet it's fast.
Ross, are you okay?
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Crap.
Hi.
Take thee, Emily...
We appear to have angered it.
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
Yeah.
Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
Here you go.
Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
I tell ya a lot things!
Hi!
Good morning.
Yeah.
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
Wow!
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!
Yeah, move over just a little bit.
Sure!
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
Scene 5, take 2.
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Which is bad, because?
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
Very bad!
Guess what, I got an audition!
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
Phoebe, come on!
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
You want some?!
I know. I like it up here.
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Me too.
Hello, sweetheart.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
G'night.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Good morning.
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
Oops.
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
You have really great hair.
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
That's because they are.
Saw Regis Philbin once...
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
Do you know where the store is?
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Bye.
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
Okay, everybody hold!
You obviously can't keep away from her.
Also large?
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
This is for the fourth grade.
They prefer it if I don't barter.
What?! I've never seen one before!
You don't have, anything?
Yeah, but even soo.
C'mon in.
Oh, hi.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
Don't spoil it.
Bye.
Pecan sandy, just made em.
Hi, Joey.
Caitlin!
Umm, I'm still here.
You think about it.
Wow, that's great.
So, can I get some candy?
Okay, anytime.
Hey.
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
How's the hired help?
Hello
Oh, I thought I heard you.
Monana was very brave.
You really need the bassinet?
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Beep!
Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
Hi, nice to meet you.
Can you really do that?
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight.
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.

Oh my God! Whoah!
Hi!
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
So, how are you doing?
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Hang on.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
No, no, they only said you.
Oh I'd like that.
That's just the way it is.
Ohhhh.
Oh, is there a problem?
Yeah!
What's wrong?
Yes, yes, do go on.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
It was you?
You're kidding. Oh my God.
Yeah. Thank you.
Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
Hey!
Oh that's me, I gotta go.
You wanna quit?
What?
Uh, you guys?
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Yes.
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
My breast milk is gross?
We're so sorry.
Sure. What?
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
That would be great!
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
I'm actually the office manager.
I gotta go.
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
Hi, honey.
Bye-bye.
Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
A tad.
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
No.
What?!
Not really.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
Can I see your license please?
How you doin there squirmy?
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Because we can remember them.
We could write it down for you?
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
Hola, Joey!
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
Rachel has those in burgendy.
Ready.
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Your name, please?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
No, Frank.
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
Get my glasses too.
Yeah, little Eric.
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Shall we?
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Uh-huh, yeah.
We've come for her things.
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Umm.
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
Yes, what's the name, please?
Oh great!
Oh, maybe that's it.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Oh hi Phoebe.
What?!
A part of him did yes.
Yeah! C'mon!
Hey, Pheebs.
Ok.
There you go.
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
Will you call him?
I can do that.
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
Yes!!
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
Hey guys.
Okay.
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
So.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
No.
I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
And Action!
Hi
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Really? You two?
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
I-I'm sorry?
An advance?
Okay.
So are you his mother or his father?
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
Ahh, yes.
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
Oh, good. Thank you.
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
Okay!
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Uhh, actually y'know what, I kinda-I have to take off.
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
Hey.
You suck!!
You did a bad thing!
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Wow.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
Wow! What an unusual cat!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
Awesome!
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Fine.
No but he didn't really talk about anything.
No.
Over a month.
No.
Am I too late?!
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
We're getting married!
But...
Hey!
No!
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Here you go.
Hi.
So, what did Francis leave me?
No, I'm picking you up.
Monica?
Yeah, refrigerator college.
How did you know there was a but?
'We' would be me and Rick.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Sorry!
Chandler.
You're doing it again.
Did you pick out the vowels?
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Here you go.
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Sorry, what?
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Three babies?
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Hey!
Ohhh, man!!
No.
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
It seemed like such a simple idea.
Where are you from?
Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.
No, you've got to whip it.
I live upstate.
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Phoebe?
Monica!
Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Oh, alright.
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
I love you, too.
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
Oh no.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
Marcel?
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
I don't have anything.
....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
8!:
Great!
Sure I do.
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Wait! We need shoes!
I know a great little place.
Thank you.
Hey! Rachel!
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
Yep.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
You have all the answers, don't you?
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
Hey, how, how did you do that?
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
Oh, thanks.
Monica! Chandler!
Oh, sorry.
No me, I am so sorry...
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Hey.
Joey.
I'm all done.
Yeah, whatever.
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Honey, honey, people are looking.
Look I want you, now.
Woooo! Yeah!
You have pets!
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
Um, thank you for the gift.
Really?! You?
Oh no!
We're gonna give it another try.
Would you like to see them?
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Screw it! I'm having one.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
It's my sister.
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
I can't imagine why.
Obviously.
How did you--?
You are so sweet.
I'm Scott.
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
No, let's just leave the lights on.
Why? So you could hang up on me?
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
Margha.
Sorry Phoebs.
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Yeah, isn't he?
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
To the Bings!
Fine.
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
Excuse me?
Chicken or small?
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.

Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
Hey!
My god, what happened?
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Cut.
Ohh!
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
Oh look at you! So handsome!
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
Attack!
No, I'm still married.
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
Yes, at 4:00.
Nora!
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Wow!
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Anytime you're ready.
No. No, I haven't seen him.
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
I'm a dancer.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
Not bad.
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
Yay!
And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
What?
Fine. I don't like you!!
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Okay.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Umm, no.
Oh, my baby!
Stay.
Hard quality.
Hey.
Yeah, I'd really like that.
I didn't read it.
All right.
Oh yeah!
Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back.
I am famished. What do I want...
Here comes the bride.
He can have his job back.
All right, fine.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
All right, from the top.
Hey! Sugar-O's!
Happy birthday sweetie.
Yes!
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Oh no.
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
It could've been a hair straightener.
Uhh...Shall I go on?
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Alright, let's take this outside.
Drake!
Well, of course.
We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Joe. How's it going?
Very nice. Very nice.
Maybe.
Did he call?
No that's my assistant.
Ah well, this is the living room.
What-what are you doing?
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Oh, just years of experience.
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
Hey! Me too!
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
Animal Control.
After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
Do you want a date Saturday?
Oh John! Great!
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Hi!
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
Went out with Joey.
Um, excuse me.
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
Hey there Ross!
I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
Drake, look out.
You mean like exclusive friends?
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Yeah, whatever. Oh no.
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Oh, it looks great!
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
Monica, wake up. Monica.
I'm Megan Bailey.
I'll just run to the store and get some.
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
You are now.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
You okay there, slugger?
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
That's weird.
Absolutely!
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
Uh huh.
I'm sorry?
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You gotta take the canoe!
Actually, I should get going.
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
Nothing.
Sorry. You look beautiful.
Rachel.
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Not her.
Sorry.
Let's take it from there.
Can you be my dancing partner?
Phoebe!
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
What's the matter?
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
No no no!
You missed the exit!
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Hang on.
Then, you're redoing it because...
What?
Hey, Rachel.
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
Hello.
Come on, touch it!
Hey. Morning, dear.
I would really like that.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
Oh! Wow! Hey!
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Bye.
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
I found the picture!
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
All right, you two, stop it!
Well...
Chandler is fantastic!!
You're welcome.
Why?
Hi!
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Actually, me too.
I came to talk to you about Howard.
Hey, where's the chicken?
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
Who?
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Uh-oh, busted!
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
No, I wanna melt it.
Would you.......Would you hug me?
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
So, who's the mystery man?
Nothing! It's an expression.
Hey Pete.
A lesbian?
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
Any minute now.
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
Yes.
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Bye Ross.
Well, you seem fine.
I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
Okay. Bye.
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Could everyone please take their seats?
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
I'm Dutch.
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
Oh. Whew!
Like lovers.
Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
Okay lady, you're out of here.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
What is in the cup?!
Drake, what're you getting at?
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Is it true they have beer?
Are you travelling with a child?
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
Plate. Plate. Plate.
We were playing rugby.
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
Why?!
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
I am supposed to be the mommy?
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
No.
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
I'm moving in.
The receipt.
Is this about me taking your watch?
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Don't you want to know about the sex?
Can I please see your face?
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Oh, great! Me too.
Hi Rachel!
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
We have our babies?
You had sex, didn't you?
Huh. Yeah?
Look, you don't want to fight me.
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
So Santa's coming?
Woah!
Aaaaah!
Cheers!
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
Okay, well g'night.
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
Oh. Oh.
Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
Well you can split it with another credit card.
Breathe, breathe, breathe...
Fabulous.
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Yay!!
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Thank you. Uh...
No that's not true. That is not true.
Youre doing it again.
You told me you didn't see anything.
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Nina.
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Take it easy.
Thank you!
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Ya know, she's having another baby.
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
I should just be happy to be near you.
Have fun.
Oh.
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
All right, see ya Pheebs.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
Hi! Remember me?
Alright.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Okay, bye!!
Well, we were...
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
Charles.
I'm right here!!!!

Really! You got a place upstate?
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Night.
Awwww!!
Nothing?
But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
Well have we finished the scene?
So, it's great to see ya.
You go get that animal outta here.
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
Oh my God!
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
Hi.
Hello?
I think he's stoned again.
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Yeah?
So it's just your mother then.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Hey baby, I'm back...
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
That's a good one.
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
You look beautiful this evening.
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
So that's your second marriage in two years.
Thanks Phoebe!
Yeah.
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Are you remaking the bed?
Nice to meet ya.
Oh.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Thanks.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
Well....
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
Just tell me the truth.
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
You owe me a cat.
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Hope you had a nice flight.
Wait. I wanna show you something.
Mmm hmmm.
Keep on scooching.
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
After you.
Which one?
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
And tell him what?
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
No, please.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Really?!
I'm just taking you outside!
Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Ah actually, that is mine.
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
So, I got the results of the amnio today.
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Ah, you... have the sex?
Jack!
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Comin' through. Move, move.
Ohh!
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
Don't, I like it dirty.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
What?!
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Wow!
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
Hi.
Why not? What's going on?
Yes...
It's not Rick.
Hey, it's everybody.
How do you know Frank?
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
Yeah, could you scooch?
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Oh, yeah!
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
We?
Rachel! Rachel!
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Yeah.
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
What?
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
Some day, maybe.
Well okay!
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Yeah?
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
Doesn't matter.
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
No, bribes.

Yeah, isn't that great?
Monica! Hi honey.
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
Oh, hi. It's Mark.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
You haven't?
What?
I'll never forget you.
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
Oh, ohhhhh.
No, no?
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Hi.
Ooooohhh.
Yeah.
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
Never mind, it's open.
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
What?
Yeah, we are.
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Bye!
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to...
Phoebe?
Can I ask what-Come on in.
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Wow!!
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
I have to get back to...
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
Oh, yeah!
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Oh hi!
Rachel?
Oh!
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
So...
See ya.
And where is your hat?
Rachel?
Me too!
I have a question about this scene.
Hey
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Excuse me?
I thought of a thing.
Your mom called me. So is this her?
How long do you want the cuffs?
So what do you want?
Amy!
Ewww!
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Yeah.
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Oh I...I think they're funny.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
Tell her what?
You're a genius, Ross.
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Oh, no, no, it's about you.
What?!
Let's reset.
Almost time for cake.
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
This one's from me.
I get that a lot.
Umm...
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Thanks.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
That's it.
Ohhhhh!
Thanks.
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Hi!
I told that guy who answered your phone.
Hello, Chandler.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
Hey, Joe.
Dear?
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
Hey hey, come on in!
Hey!
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
You mean dying man?
Yeah.
He's got a girlfriend!
So you guys want me to take this back?
Wasn't it?
It's okay, Rachel knows.
Don't be too long.
Chandler?
Well, this all looks good.
Yeah.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
Hi!
Okay!
No, not getting my bra!
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Yeah, let's go.
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
I thought it went very well.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Yeah. Oh.
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
Okay.
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Thanks.
I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before.
Yeah, I heard it.
Yeah.
We will.
But how about tomorrow?
What?
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Are you being British?!
Great!
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
Do you want to know?
Oh, come on!
Hi, Kate!
Oh, okay.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Hi darling.
Which one?
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
I saw Richard.
Oh, Ross!
Well, that could take a while.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
I'll take a look at him.
Hey you're in our seats.
Excuse me?
No, no, no.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Just a small tranquiliser.
Do you know who at my office?
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
Okay.
Rachel!
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.
Hey!
I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
I wish I could talk to her.
Hi!
You're so welcome.
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Are they, uh, firm?
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Um
All right!
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Like it would help.
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Yeah?
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Hey!
Oh really?
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
I am gonna try and quit drinking.
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
It's kidney stones.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Hey.
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
What? Do you think he likes me?
I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Just relax. Just relax Paul, you're doing great. She likes you. She... Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y'know why? Because you're a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. I'm just a love machine and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! Showtime. I'm just a love machine, yeah ba-by!
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
Okay, okay.
N.Y.P.D!!
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Would you like to call somebody?
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
What do you, what do you think?
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Now, which of you is the father?
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
What?
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
Uh sure.
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Okay!
Um, cheers.
God, your hair sure is different!
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
Out!
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
Well, I'm from California.
Hi.
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
Right. Could you sign this?
N-No running in the chapel!
Ready, Annabelle?
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
Cut! Wonderful!
Okay. Okay.
Hey, Rach!
She's not here and please come in.
You brought a carrot.
Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
I was her accountant four years ago.
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
Oh shout, that would have been fun.
Oh, excellent.
You were right.
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
Jack used to handle the finances!
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
How about Mama Lisettie's?
Got 'em.
I can help with that.
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
No.
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Yeah.
I love you Drake.
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
How ya doin'?
I feel good! ...Who are you?
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
Are you talking about having sex?
Oh yeah!
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
No we won't.
Oh that was a real person?!
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
What?! Anything! Anything!
I'd better get back to my desk.
Oh. Thanks.
What?
I'm in my boss's car!
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
What?!
I'll be in in a minute.
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Sorry.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
Will you be my maid of honour?
God. I love you.
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Jen.
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
What are these, stitches?
Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Now go!
You know where I work!
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
What do you mean, your seat?
Hi! What are you doing here?
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Speech! Come on Monica!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
I know a guy who's the 18th.
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Hey.
Isn't there?
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
We've got a problem.
Hey Ross!
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
Still no smile?
Mmm.
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
Hello everybody!
Nothing at all?
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
Can I help you?
We really do feel bad about this though.
Umm, yeah-no thanks.
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
This is a great picture.
Alright, let me just get my coat.
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Totally and completely healthy!
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Working with blind kids.
Hello?
Periodontist.
It's called the cherry.
Me.
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
No, I don't know him.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
Uh-oh!
That's not true?
You don't secretly smoke do you?
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
Oh, excuse me.
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
Ohh. Hi!
What? Alright, what about my two?
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
No, I ahh, had another idea.
Eight months.
What is with you tonight?

Frank Jr. Jr.!!
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
What's...
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
I'll see you later.
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
Oh Jack stop.
That's Carol with your son!
Oh!
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Don't talk to me now!
As in my grandmother.
Yeah?
Hi honey.
What?!
Ohh.
Hello!
You guys tell them you were married?
Oh, I love you too. But...
Rachel?
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
You stop!
Yes?
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
Looks like that might come any minute.
No, I-I-I gotta go.
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
No.
Let's go Phoebe!
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Oy!
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.
Then, what's the problem?
Come on, lady!
How are you?
Surprise!!
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
Yes?
Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Sorry.
That's so sweet.
Hey. Hi Phoebe.
Ewww!!!
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
Nooo.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
Let's never speak of this.
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Mmmm!
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
All right. Here's your first baby.
What's different?
Hi! Hey!
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
Good to see you too!
Saltines?
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
I don't want to talk about it.
Hey!
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
Dysprosium.
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
Yes, Waltham interiors.
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
What's he talking about?
I think I need a drink.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Look, I. . .
Stop saying that. I hate that.
That's so exciting.
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Well that's not true.
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Excuse me?
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
Are you close with them?
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Eeeee!
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Whoa! Ohh!!
He's sleeping.
You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Yuh.
Yeah.
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
Oh good.
Ohh, I'm sorry.
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
More of Grandma's teramisu.
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Hi!
Well, here's your phone doctor.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
Well, if you want, you can work here.
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
Hey Joey.
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
What do you mean?
Can he handle the stick?
No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
What?!
It was.
Susan and I live together.
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
Oh, hi, darling!
So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
What is it, Tim?
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Do you have a sec?
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
It's perfect.
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
Okay.
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Oh! ...Hello, dear.
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
I'll be okay.
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.
Okay! Okay!
Okay, Chandler, come on!
What one?
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Hi.
Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Geller!
Hey!
Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Oh really?
I've got no reason to stay.
So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
Drops!
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Hey.
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
I heard ya.
Yeah, okay. Alright.
One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Okay, we're not.
Why are you yelling?
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Why?
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
A sandwich?
Isn't this great?!
And I do have one seat left.
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Do you not want to be seen with me?
The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Come on! Speech!
Hey, Dr. Farber.
1 minute 50 seconds.
What happened to the library?
Morning. Good morning.
What?
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
Alrighty. From the top.
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Okay!
Wow, you have really pretty feet.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Hey!
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
No, it's you!
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
Rachel Green's office.
What?
You think so too?
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Is there a problem?
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
Phoebe...
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
What's happening to your accent?
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
So you guys want coffees?
What kinda change?
Dope!
I wasn't invited.
Hi!
We're closing.
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
What?
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
He would like to kiss you.
Oh.... my.... God.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
Absolutely, yeah!
Come in.
Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Ameri-ccan.
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Is everything all right?
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Yeah.
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.
Yes!!
Thing?
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
Yes.

Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
Good luck!
Do I know you?
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
Baywatch!!
Oh my God!
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
Yeah!
Hey.
Lovely to meet you.
So what did you do today?
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
How hot are we?
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
So what. I say, punch him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
Rachel?
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
How are you?
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Hi.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Sure.
What?
What?
It isn't.
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
She took all my stuff.
'Cause you guys were on a break.
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Happy Valentine's Day!
I got you...these.
So glad you brought someone.
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
Hi.
Nice to meet you Joey.
Okay...
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Bye.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
Hey Chandler.
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
Roll-roll!!
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Or your keys.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Yeah, yeah, maybe.
Hi!
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Morning.
Nope.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Yeah. Yeah. A little.
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Keep singing! Keep singing!
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Sure.
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Okay.
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Here you go.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Here let me...
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
You put your balloons down!!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
I could play the oboe!
Oh my God. I think you're right.
You don't say!
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
Happy birthday sweetie.
Ross, you remember Susan.
It's my baby too.
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
That could be it.
Is Tony Randall dead?
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
No. Have you seen David?
Bakersfield.
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
God! What are you, in second grade?
Like what?
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
Ross!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
Cut!
May I help you?

I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
So you like it?
Hockey! Hockey! Hockey.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yeah! Yep.
Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
I do know.
Are you guys ready?
Nooo!
That's okay.
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
She broke my arm.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
And for the gentleman?
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Its Jake.
Stay well.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
Phoebe, listen...
That's cool. Cool.
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Okay.
You mean like watch?
$4.50 please.
Looks good.
Hallelujah!
That's great! That's wonderful!
Yeah.
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
Uh-huh, I don't know.
What?!
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
Me?!
Hello, is Ross there?
That's great! Hey! Excellent!
Sooo, you've been doing this long?
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
String?
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Okay.
He does?
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
Yes!
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Okay. Let's do it again.
What the hell!!!
And who is your friend?
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
Um-hum, you're jealous.
No.
Can I get you something from the bar?
Oh Drake.
Hey.
Okay.
Great!
Oh thank you.
Hey, everybody!
Christmas eve.
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
So?
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
Bye.
Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.
Hey, we were sitting there.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Hello.
Certainly.
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Oh my God!!
Give me a 'for instance'.
All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
Just us.
All right.
I missed this.
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
That was an accident! And so were you.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
Hey!
In The Category Of Favorite Returning Male Character The Nominees Are John Wheeler from General Hospital , Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless , Dunkin Harrington from Passions , and Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives . And the Soapie goes to......Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless!
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
It's nice to have a boyfriend.
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Oh please!
Show me in the table.
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Yeah! Right!
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I love you, love you.
Yeah.
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Oh I know!!
Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
Yes?
He didn't have any.
Yeah.
Chicken? Chicken boy!
You are!
I don't care! You just get him!
Hi.
Hi Rachel!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Hey, Chandler!
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Okay, see ya.
Great!
Monica.
I know. I'm mad at me too.
How's my Bing-a-ling?
How are you honey?
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
Wh..
Is that supportive?
You never know.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
Carol, not me.
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
That's all!
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Who are you?
No.
I am?
That's my job!
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
Oh my God!
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
We agreed on Minnie.
Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
Hi, I'm Sandy.
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
Yeah.
Wow!
What?!
Hi!
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
I've had a really good time tonight.
What?
But, you got up!
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
Hey!
I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
But like how?
Hey! You can't go back there!
Uh, yes.
So, are you a member of any gym.
A little what?
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
You make me laugh.
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
No, but I'm asking-
You have a son?
Maybe in L.A?
You're Erwin's daughter?!
You are!
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
Oh, yeah. I know that.
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
Right.
Life partner.
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Yeah.
Yeah, OK.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
That would work.
Dennis.
What's going on?
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
I do Raquel.
Mornin'.
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Ross!
Hey!
Oh, no thanks.
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
Or?
Ohh, nice choice.
No, no, no. What was that?
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Hi Phoebe.
Where do you work?
Are they, uh, firm?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Hey!
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
I just did them.
Great.
Good evening.
We love you. Buy.
And while we're on the subject of news..
Yeah.
Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
Hello.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
So, have you kids eaten yet?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Which guy?
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Lose the robe.
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
Honey.
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
Well, that was ah...
He's Bobby Bobby?
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
1200.
It is Judy.
Oh! Yeah!
That can be arranged.
Do you?
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
Bye.
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
No dear. It's not.
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Tomatoes are squishing.
By being in a box?
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
What if you put them here.
Oh, am I on the radio?
Who-who else is in vice up there?
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
Hey pal.
Maybe.
Bye Joey. Last night was fun.
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
What?
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
She's not making me uncomfortable.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Hey.
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Meet me in the bathroom.
Thanks, any suggestions?
What?! What would make you think that?
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
Would you like to move over to the couch?
You are?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Oh, yeah!
Huh!
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
But we broke up.
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Oh please, a relationship.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
Oh. Thank you.
How?
Hi!
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
I like Ross.
Hi, Phoe.
Well, you were fired.
Why, what happened?
Yeah, okay, bye.
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
No, don't worry about it.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no.
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Ross? What's with the neck?
I don't speak English.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
I guess so.
If that helps you.
No.
Want us to go?
My fish, Buddy.
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
No.
Wow!
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Jack, would you let it go?
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Why would you say that?
You are!
Phoebe. Hi.
What do we got here?
Okay.
Hey!
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Is there a Julio here?
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
Hi Joey.
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Here's your scone.
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
I know. That's what I told her.
We were just talking about you.
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Yep.
How could I have left them in the copy room?
Hey guy!
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Oh my God!!
Oh, really?
All right.
Hello?
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
You don't wanna know.
Good deal.
Hey, Monica!
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
Uh, no, Susan and me.
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
Wow, love your new nose!
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
Oh my God.
No, we are. I'm sad.
Hello darlings.
I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.
Thank you.
Yeah!
I can't say.
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
Hey!
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
Oh!
I guess.
E!
That's fine, thank you.
Rachel?
Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
You've been married twice?
Well, she has issues.
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
Yes, and she's very supportive.
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
You dog!
There you go.
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Can't hear you!
But...
Wow!
So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
Philadelphia.
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
No.
I thought you didn't smoke.
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
Umm, do you sell these bags?
What is wrong now?!
I gotta friend named Mark.
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
No I don't think so.
Helloo!!
What's the matter with him?
No, I really did forget my purse.
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
I'm, I'm still me.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Hi, can I help you?
Hi!
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
So uh, who's your photographer?
Whoa!!
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
Look I just thought that...
You're into hardcore S&M right?
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
When?
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
A surfer.
Yeah.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Oh.
She's here.
Oh yes there is!
I found the picture!
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Great!
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Right, and...
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
I'm in love with you.
Hmm?
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
Aren't you going to swallow that?
Rach! Rach!
So, I hear, you hate me!
Okay.
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
All right.
Here, I'll get it.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Hi.
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
She may have died?
Do I dare ask?
Your grandmother would have hated this.
It's a lovely apartment.
Yeah, they're not so bad.
Ok, this could go on for a while.
Yes, yes I was.
Let's go!!
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Excuse me?
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
Thank you sweetheart.
Okay.
