Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Oh!
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
What about it?
Why should we?
Why?!
You had sex with her didn't you?
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
All right, let's try one.
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Pizza delivery!
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
You gotta take the canoe!
You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Thanks.
Give me the dice.
Carol, not me.
Dr. Geller!
Right! But, I am sorry.
Hi Kim.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
$4.50 please.
I'm all done.
Yeah.
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
What?
Hi!
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
Ohh, I'm sorry.
No help required Chico.
Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
Lemonade? You ok man?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Okay...
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
Joey...
Then we agree?
That's so sweet.
What's up?
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or...
I'll see you later.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
Hello, is Ross there?
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
Yeah.
Rachel.
Ahh, yes.
It really says that?!
Hey.
I felt it!
This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
It got caught on my watch.
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
I love you, too.
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
I don't think so dear.
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Okay, everybody hold!
It did at first, but not anymore.
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
What?!!
A test?!!
Or your keys.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Ahh, are you hadsome.
Why don't we do a trial run.
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Really?!
We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
Want us to go?
Potassium.
So uh, do you live around here?
Hey! You're back!
Oh, ohhhhh.
Are you interested in this ring?!
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Hi!
Oh. Oh.
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
You really sure?
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
I am supposed to be the mommy?
Ohh, it's a bit small.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
Marlon-
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
I'm moving in.
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
No, I hate cats.
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Well, you certainly own that room.
When's your birthday?
Okay.
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
SURPRISE!!!
What?
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Who?!
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
No, you've got to whip it.
That's where you pick up the bag.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Where?
You brought a carrot.
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
Joey.
Hi Kim.
I'm sorry?
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Yeah, I'm her date.
Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here!
You had sex, didn't you?
Hi! Hey!
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
No, no, no. What was that?
What?
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
We're back on.
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
You're not gonna speed anymore right?

You have not changed!
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
Call me.
Well that's ambitious.
Oh Hans.
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
Alright!
Well, sure, that too.
Yep.
Oh.
I see the head.
That's sweet. Could I take her?
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
Come on.
According to recent findings!
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
Yeah, well..
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Yep. Pretty much.
Whats she doing here?
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Hi Rachel.
Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
Did anybody call for security?
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
An advance?
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
You OK?
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Oy.
I can't help you Joey.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Well, that could take a while.
Oh, hi, darling!
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
That's right.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
We have great news!
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
Okay!
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm all...in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hang on.
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Hey
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
He's getting married tomorrow right?
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Yeah.
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Crap.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
It's called the cherry.
Oh God!
My fish, Buddy.
So I was wondering....
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
Wooooo!!!!
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
May I see your boarding pass?
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
Thank you. Uh...
Thanks daddy.
I won! That was my quarter!
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
If you want it to be.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
Umm, no, I don't think so.
You're look for laughable...
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
Perfection?
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Hi!
Phoebe, listen...
"You have two new messages."
I know a great little place.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Hi!
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
Hey!
Uh, may I help you?
Which is bad, because?
What?
Yes! Yes! You did!
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
You go get that animal outta here.
Mockolate.
Stop it!
Uhh-huh.
Bye dad.
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
I got it.
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
It's kidney stones.
What are you doing?
How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
These got left for ya.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
For Chandler!
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
Ya know, she's having another baby.
What's in the cup, Ross?
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
So, all right.
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
Nice shot.
Who are you?!
Yeah!
Oh.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Great!
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
Uh, is your name Chandler?
Any progress?
I think we've seen enough!
Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
You think so too?
Hello darlings.
When I was six years old.
Ross? Ross?
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Hey guys!
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
He didn't have any.
You don't have it anymore?
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
Who's they?
Joey!
Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
No! Come on!
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
No, I really did forget my purse.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
Surprise!
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Yeah! C'mon!
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
Drake!
Hi!
Yeah, we'll see!
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
So, who's the lucky guy?
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
We?
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
He better go on for what I'm paying.
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
What'd you think I was, a hooker?
Yeah, they're out of town.
Hey!
Oh, well, I'll show you around.
No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
What?!
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
Hey!
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
What did he say?
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
And Rog.
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
Life partner.
Joey, bravo!
It's yours!
Son of a bitch!
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
It's, uh, it's Paul.
All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
You are an idiot. .
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
What?
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
I just hope...
'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
What?
How?
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
I love you Phoebe.
Just call me Paul.
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
What?
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
You want some?!
Okay.
Sure.
Mar-gha.
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Hangs up.
She may have died?
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Drake, look out.
Hey!
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
Really?!
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.

Sure!
No, let me explain! Fired!!
All right.
Oh!!
Oh no.

She's here.
That's fine.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?

That might be fun.

Ready?
Just those two!
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
No.
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.

What like Pete Dakota?
Joey.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
Phoebe!

It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?

As were you.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Ahh, look at you, you look great.
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
No.
Taxi.
Like it would help.
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
And who may I say is calling?
Ohh, brisk tonight.
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
You have pets!
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
N-No running in the chapel!
What's wrong?
I'm afraid so.
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Okay.
So? I mean have you thought about it?
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
Well she said she had to think things over.
Why?!
No, I wanna melt it.
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
You are so adorable.
Now, which of you is the father?
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Hi.
Okay!
I think he's stoned again.
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Yeah. What?
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
Whoa!
What happened son?
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Is that supportive?
In the park?
Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
Guess what, I got an audition!
Let it go, Ross.
Woooo! Yeah!
Would ya care to venture one?
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
Ross, you remember Susan.
I just, I thought Joey was there.
What's goin' on?
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
Yes! Phoebe.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
Bye-bye.
Auntie Monica!!
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
What?!
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
No problem.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
Thank you! Good meeting you.
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
No but he didn't really talk about anything.
So?
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
God bless the chickpea.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Wait, just a second.
I'm kidding.
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
Joey!
You.
Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Hallelujah!
Monopoly!
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Thank you, Max. Thank you.
Ross? That opens my cervix.
G'night.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
Uh, no, Susan and me.
Like lovers.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.

Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Sorry.
That's not all.
Tag Jones.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
No. No, I haven't seen him.
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Hockey! Hockey! Hockey.
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Come in.
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
You're gonna kill me!
Hey guys! Hey!
Girls, sit down.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
Congratulations! Congrats!
Really?!
I can show you an ID if you want?
Oh, no thanks.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Yay!!
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
Who? Me the attacker?
Chandler?
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
Three.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
And for you?
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Mmm.
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
Chandler is fantastic!!
Hello.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
I really can't say.
Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
Hey!
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
I'm here!
Say something..... hot.
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Its Jake.
But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
Yeah!
Action!
Definitely her.
C'mon in.
Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Oh!
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
What are you doing?
Ross, I love you!
Hi!
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
There you go.
Here's your scone.
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
And for the gentleman?
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Doesn't matter.
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
Y'know what? We need to move on.
Here we go.
1200.
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
Oh. They don't.
Excuse me?
Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Yep.
Yesss?
No dear. It's not.
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
You are!
Goodbye Geller.
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
You don't say!
Eh.
Rachel?
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Just aim for the bump.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Monica, you asked the question.
Sir?
No, but it did! Didn't it?!
Okay.
Oh Drake.
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Nobody! We put them in here!
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Oh!
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Tell me about it!
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
No me, I am so sorry...
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
What contracts?
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Yeah.
Some day, maybe.
Marcel?
Way to go, Phoebe!
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Guess who?
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Bye Ross.
Sure.
Thank you.
I am not telling you guys anything.
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
Who is it?
Normally, I would not do it.
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
Yeah.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
That's great!
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
Who-who else is in vice up there?
Hello all!
Hello everybody!
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
No.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
No!
Well, of course.
I'm sorry.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Isn't this great?!
Salad.
Morning's here! The morning's here!
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
Phoebe?
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
But like how?
Good evening.
Yay!!
Pizza guy!
No.
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
Fine, whatever.
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Sorry.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Take 36 is up!
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
A lesbian?
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
Yeah! Oh my God!
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Is that my ass?
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
Yeah?
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
The Celtics.
What?!
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
Because I-I like you.
Oh, you know what?
Phoebe. Hi.
What was all that about?
Monica bang!
Your not doing it.
Let's never speak of this.
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
No!
Uh-huh.
Move!
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Her name's Debra.
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Do you know where the store is?
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
We kinda broke up this morning.
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
Ready.
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Ow! Did you just bite me?
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
The dark of night has disappeared!!
Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Hello! Who's in there?
Hello. Hello.
What is this place?
He told me in person.
Hi.
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
What?
This couch belongs to us.
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.
Also Monday.
Eew! It's creepy looking!
She's supposed to be with you.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
Mrs. Geller?
Oh my God, Phoebe.
I found the picture!
They still want me for General Hospital.
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
What?!
How did you know we were here?
Yo!!
Really? You two?
It is Judy.
Oh, good. Thank you.
Oh! Okay! Phew!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Chicken or small?
What?
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
Okay, Chandler, come on!
Not.... helping!
I'll see you.
Mmm.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
So you guys want coffees?
'Cause you guys were on a break.
Okay!
Monica.
Really?
You found that handle, did ya?
Which do I like?
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Hey Monica, how's it going.
Why don't we start right now!
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
Um, yeah, I'm just... ..working.
That's about 60 cents.
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
No. No, you're not a loser.
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
No, not getting my bra!
But, you're not identical twins.
Okayyy!
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Okay!
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Your... excuse me?
What's going on over here?
What woman?!
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Oh, yeah. I know that.
Yep.
Doctor Ross Geller.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Really?!
Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
Pecan sandy, just made em.
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
The other us.
Neat.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Ow!
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Well, he's doing terrible!
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
No you stop!
Are you being British?!
Good idea! Yes!
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.

Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Me?!
Did I put too much rum in here?
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
Thanks.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Very tasteful.
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
What is with you tonight?
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
What did Joey say? I like you back?
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
When?
It's laminated!
What's too much fun?
Ohh, Ross, please!
Okay lady, you're out of here.
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Mon-Monica?
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
And where is your hat?
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Phoebe! That's a great name.
What?
Thanks.
Hi.
You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Me too.
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
He does?
What?
So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Behind you?
Give me a 'for instance'.
Hi.
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
Good morning!
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
13.
Are those your teeth??
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
It's a curling iron.
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
But it's my car!
Well that wasn't easy.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
Sorry, members only.
Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
Ross!
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Oh my God!
Oh, so did I.
Okay.
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.
Oh! Oh, God!
Yes.
Ohhhh.
Hey you're in our seats.
I suppose mainly sexual.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
What?! Why?!
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Absolutely!
Well,... thanks.
Okay.
'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch...
But we broke up.
Oh Joey!
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Why would you say that?
Don't spoil it.
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
Esther Livingston. Gone.
Yeah.
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
There is no father.
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
No, it was. It was very very good.
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
That's my job!
No come on. Come on tell me.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
What?
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
But you're not. Okay, good.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...
I had a sister.
Oh my God!
Oh!!
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Oh, excellent.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
Yeah, okay.
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
Speech! Come on Monica!
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Oh?
Very nice. Very nice.
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Ohh great.
Thanks.
Or I'll hear you.
Okay.
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
Hello?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Yeah?
Ross.
January first.
Yes sir.
Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.
To the Bings!
Hi!
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Hmm.
You may kiss the bride.
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
It's a bathing suit?
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
You have me!
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Sure.
You must be Ross.
Oh crap!
Like this.
Good deal.
Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
Ew, this feels very weird.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Wait!
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
Let's take it from there.
Nope.
Hey!
Hey!
Nice to meet you Mac!
Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Oh, here they are right here.
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Oh, no, no, it's about you.
No, Frank.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Oh damnit!
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
So umm, are we cool?
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
Let's reset.
Ohh!
Lovely, just lovely.
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
Hey, Monica!
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Hey guys.
I have to get back to...
I don't care! You just get him!
Can't wait!
Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
You are so sweet.
Yeah.
You've been married twice?
Nooo!!
Would you like some gum?
Ah here, we brought wine.
Oh that's me, I gotta go.
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Hey what?
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
Here, I'll get it.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Your name, please?
Oy!
Keep on scooching.
Gay!
How could I have left them in the copy room?
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
So, you look great.
Why?
Come on.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
How you doin there squirmy?
Wow!
You got it.
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Just ah...
Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
What?!
Thanks!
Whenever you're ready.
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Right.
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Helloo!!
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Honey, honey, people are looking.
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
Who told you that?
What?!
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
I'd really rather talk to him.
Okay.
What?
Good choice.
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
I don't think she'd like that.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I don't think so.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
Did he call?
I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
Ahh.
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
No, I'm sorry.
Oh my God. I think you're right.
Okay.
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm...
Yeah.
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Rachel has those in burgendy.
Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
Here, we are.
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Impressive.
No, Joey!
Cut!
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Morning. Good morning.
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
Yay!
Well, it's nice to know that you...
No, the man is a mess.
Hey, you.
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
Ahh!
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
This is impossible. Its just impossible.
Hey!
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
No! I went with Mindy.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Meet me in the bathroom.
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
Ross, sweetheart!
Call security. Pheebs, didn't you get fired?
Hey!
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Things change, roll with em.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Okay, bye!!
Here let me...
Hello?
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
No.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
Yeah. Yeah. A little.
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Hombre?
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
All right. Here's your first baby.
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
Um-hmm.
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
We're still rolling!
You too.
Mmm.
Oh cool! You made him cry!
Minsk. It's in Russia.
Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you're surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
Hi, Lauren.
I'm sorry?
Do you have a minute?
Hey guy!
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
He's sleeping.
Phoebe?
Rachel?
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
Really?!
Oh Fonzie.
Yeah. From the top?
Goodbye.
Yeah, thanks.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Of course! It's her favorite.
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
Allright!
Amen!
What was that?
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
It's clean.
Well y'know, he's got access.
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
Here, let me help.
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Ahh, nooo!!
Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
Oh my!
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
Cool! I'll catch up!
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Sooo, you've been doing this long?
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
Come on over here, sweetheart.
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
What?
Ok, this could go on for a while.
Sure, I'd like that.
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
What?!
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
What, wait, you mean like this?
Oh, umm, all right.
Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
Oh, you're welcome.
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
You are?
So, can I get some candy?
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
Yeah.
That's kinda sad.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
Judy, the kids..
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Nooo!
So...
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
L!
That's so great for you guys!
Oh, I thought I heard you.
It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
Uhh, I can't.
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Yeah, I was just kidding.
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
You can't.
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
I didn't read it.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
Morning.
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
You have really great hair.
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Oh!
But were fine.
Okay.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
...from the syphilis.
The one with "Heston" on it.
Drink?
Well I just thought...
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
This does.
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Bite me, blondie!
Jack.
Do you two know each other?
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
Hi!
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
Hi, Phoe.
All right then, it's settled.
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
You ready to go?
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Hi!
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
You may kiss the bride.
Oh.
Yeah?
I'm just taking you outside!
Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
Okay.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
What are you doing here?
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
How to make the next one even shorter?
Hi.
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
You used to be my babysitter.
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
No.
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Right! Okay.
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
Happy birthday sweetie.
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
All right, from the top.
Hi! What are you doing here?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
So what did you do today?
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Mr. Tribbiani.
Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
God, your hair sure is different!
You ready to go to the batting cage?
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Tell me everything.
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
What's a virgin?
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Almost time for cake.
How are you?
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Hi!
Oh that would be great!
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Alright.
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
May I help you?
Yeah, get out! Now!
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
What?!
This is a glaucoma test.
You wanna go down to the office right now?
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
You probably want us to move in together?
What are you guys doing?!
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
I know! It's awful. I love you.
For all the free food you gave away.
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
Hey.
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
That's Carol with your son!
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Yeah, can I help you with something?
How's it gonna be all right?!
Yeah.
Yes!
Where did you get this number?
Nope.
Roll-roll!!
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Yeah.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
No.
The guy with the gas?!
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
Mmm hmmm.
Could you guys help me?
Whoa!!
You always said I'd make it.
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
What's happening to your accent?
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
You do?
No.
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
Oh, okay, I get it.
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
It's lovely to meet you.
Hi.
Huh, good luck!
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Diet Coke.
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, I didn't, I didn't know that.
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
Hey!
Bye.
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
We kinda need to talk.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Well of course I am!
Oh yeah!
Doorknob?
No, I have faith...
Wow.
No, I'm not.
So this is it? Victor?
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
I'll be right back.
No! Why does he have to go?
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
Ohh, nice choice.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Nothing at all?
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
Hey!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
Okay!
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Hey!
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
Hey Phoebe.
Oh yes, there you are.
Maybe.
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
Hi.
Yes I am.
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Hey, mate.
Someone in there?
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Both of you?
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
Which one?
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
We learned how to dance.
Come on. I'll let you lead.
Wow!
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
I'm sorry, who are you?
So, would you like any dessert?
Ross.
Christmas.
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Yeah!
What?
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
Wow! You are really good at this.
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
Oh, god.
Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Sorry. You look beautiful.
What-what's going on?!
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Tomatoes are squishing.
Where are we?
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Oh, is there a problem?
Is that an expensive blouse?
Wow.
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Ohhh.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
What? Alright, what about my two?
Happy birthday.
No.
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Where have you been?
Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
Umm, I'm still here.
Okay.
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
Okay.
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Me too.
Breathe.
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Wh-what's that?
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
Hi! Hello!
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
...Like, ...all of them?
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
No.
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
C'MON!
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
They-they-they can smell fear.
Not bad.
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
You really need the bassinet?
When are you coming home?
You mean Dr. Geller?
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
Who in the hell are you?
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
Need uh, need a little hand there.
Oh great!
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
That's because they are.
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
I love you, love you.
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
Okay, I can let it go at eight.
Hey hey, come on in!
Ross! Wait!
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Oh my God!
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
Pizza delivery.
Well, we had a table in college.
Hey Danny.
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Dr. Oberman.
Do you know who at my office?
Why?!
Come on, lady!
I talk in my sleep.
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
What?
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
No way!
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Yeah! As long as we're here!
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Chandler!
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Look, you don't want to fight me.
No no no!
Yeah?
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
Three babies?
He went out with my wife!
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Hey.
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Daddy!!
Hey.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
Surprise!!
Can't complain.
But, you got up!
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
Well, they don't have to know that...
Then don't break in!!
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Bakersfield.
What?! Why?
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
What's my last name?
Yeah!
That can be arranged.
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Don't talk to me now!
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
Op.
Bye.
Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
I hear you can get people out of here.
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
Plate. Plate. Plate.
Breathe.
But my apartment is so...
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Hey.
Y'know what?
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Why'd you freak out?
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Joey!
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Hope! Hope!
Just keep smiling.
Cut!
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Where are you from?
Red Barbra?
Yeah, OK.
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
He would like to kiss you.
What?
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Monica! Chandler!
I forgot my paper.
Oh my God!!
Yes, yes, do go on.
Where you goin'?
Well I'm sorry.

-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
Yeah, whatever. Oh no.
Oh! God! Wow!
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Thank goodness.
Jack used to handle the finances!
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Do you still work here?
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
Who?
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
We will.
3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
Yes, yes I was.
Can you really do that?
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
I am so sorry.
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Daddy!
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
Dance with him.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
Oh, hi. It's Mark.
He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
Kidney stones!
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
Cut.
Hey!
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
Yeah, OK.
You're welcome.
Oh, alright.
Bye!
Just us.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
Ohhhhhh!
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
But how about tomorrow?
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
Any luck?
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Ready?
Kinda.
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
That saves us a conversation.
Hey.
Why don't you try to do-
Yes!
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
All right. This is the kitchen.
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
This almost never happens!
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
We appear to have angered it.
Well, you seem fine.
You're so welcome.
Sorry.
No, I mean it's not Geller.
This will be your phone.
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
Right. Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Ready?
Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
Yes we are. So, coffee?
The pizza-place across the street any good?
Yeah! That would be great!
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
I'll just run to the store and get some.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Hi, I'm Sandy.
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
So what. I say, punch him.
Ohhh! Put it out!
Really? Well, in that case...
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Coffee.
Spring vacation.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Ahh, are you hadsome.
No.
Bye.
Can I ask what-Come on in.
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Where are you Vic?
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
Yeah.
I, I don't know.
E!
Sorry.

No, but I'm asking-
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
Here you go.
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
Uh, plate?
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
And Action!
But, we are.
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
So we can go out again?
We'll go to a hotel.
He says he was too.
Sure.
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
Which guy?
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
But...
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Hey!
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Oh yeah. See you guys.
Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
No, no!
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Youre doing it again.
Rachel's coming up the path. Doesn't she look pretty. Jack...
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
Who are you?
Oh, hi.
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
Mornin'.
What're you doing? Are you scratching?
Is it true they have beer?
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Oh.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Looks good. I'll take it.
Don't you want to know about the sex?
No, she touched mine first!
Push, push!
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Ross!
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
One ticket to Yemen?
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Hey.
How you doin'?
I got you...these.
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
We never get smacked.
What's a nubbin?
Who?
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
Bing! That's a great name.
Hi.
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
Why not? What's going on?
What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Certainly.
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
I know. I hate that!
Okay, you guys free tonight?
That's really a day shoe.
Good morning.
Joey, onstage!
Why would you think that?
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
Oh, Jack.
They're your backup singers... beind you.
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Hi. I'm Monica.
All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Oh Drake.
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
Hi!
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
I'm Irish.
Maybe.
Monica bang!
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
Yeah, let's go.
Bye.
Nice to meet you.
We're still on this side of the door.
Wow.
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
And look where they're sitting.
Yes. Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!
Morning!
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
You are so fired.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
Oh! ...Hello, dear.
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
Alright!
Talk to me.
C'mere, Patti.
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
He started it!
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Okay. Okay.

Each.
No!
Hope you had a nice flight.
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
Hey Chandler.
Well...
Hey Ross!
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Yeah.
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...
Yeah, isn't he?
No we won't.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
I do Raquel.
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Oh Rachel, uhh...
See ya.
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
It's Alan.
Thanks.
Why? What you'd do?
Me too.
Woah.
Are you sure?
Why are you yelling?
Do you?
Okay.
Hey, it's everybody.
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
A little what?
I wish I could talk to her.
What can I say? She nailed it.
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
Phoebe, come on!
It's the Gellers!
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

What's with this guy?
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Like what?
What people?
What's wrong?
What's he talking about?
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
We've got a problem.
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
Hi Ross.
Oh, thanks.
Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
You're paying for that.
Yes.
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
Oh! Oh!
Five oh dollars.
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
What?
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
Hey!
That's funny. Who are they?
No.
It's my sister.
I'll see you after work sweetie.
Who's out there?
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
Yes!
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
Pizza!
I guess we just keep dancing.
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Well okay!
Hey. I was...
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
...says $30 Father; same as in town.
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
You were saying?
Hey, Phoebe.
Monica.
It was my quarter!
Hello Tilly.
What?
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
Oooh!
Wow! Well, welcome back!
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Rachel is my girlfriend.
Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to...
Aren't you going to swallow that?
Oh, that's better then.
We're outta here!
Hi!
Of course!
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Hey Ross!
Huuh.
Do I know you?
Noo! NO!
Okay. Will you marry me?
Excuse me?
Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go...
Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
Bye.
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
So long, Vic!
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
All right.
Hey Chandler?
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
Really?!
Come on!
Dad!!
What are these, stitches?
Okay, she was here, but she left.
He's got a girlfriend!
No.
Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
I miss you already!!
What?
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
Dudes.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Oh my God!
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
What about Benitez?
That's my wife!!! Get out!
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
But you're not anymore!
You must be so happy!
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
Rachel.
Good to see you again!
Okay, so it's a date.
Here you go honey!
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
We're closing.
That's a good one.
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
Is Brian...?
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
That's great.
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
What?!
Ooooohhh.
Not really.
Let's go!!
Yes, what's the name, please?
Melt stuff.
I'll talk to her.
You kids ready?
But...
Come on in.
I did.
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
Huh?
Oh I'd like that.
Okay.
It's nice to have a boyfriend.
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Hello.
You did a bad thing!
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Thank you.
Hey guys.
Well there's one and there's another .
Ohh! That's great!
No no no.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Actually, me too.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
Err... we know what we want.
What?!
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
Uh-huh!
Why aren't you at home in bed?
I love you Drake.
I'm in love with you.
Ms. Waltham?
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Your eyes are very pretty.
With a K.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Nope! That never happened to me!
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
We've come for her things.
Hi Ralph.
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Don't touch him!
Wow!
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Please, please take him too.
Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Bakersfield!
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
Uh.
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Sweetheart, sweetheart...
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
What's wrong, sweetie?
Uhh, yeah.
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
Here I am!
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
It's perfect.
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
Really.
Hey, you like pizza?
I'll do it.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
You know where I work!
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
What did you say?!
Lovely to meet you.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Like what?
Really, y'think so? I don't..
Oh, don't worry about it.
Yeah, refrigerator college.
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
I don't know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy... Why can't I just pick someone like you?
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Hi.
I wish I could.
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
I am?!
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Oh! You know what I need?
I thought you didn't smoke.
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
I'm a dancer.
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
Oh really?
Hello.
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
Dear?
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
I did not!
No, bribes.
Oh, it looks great!
Um, thank you for the gift.
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
We get high.
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Ross!
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Yeah?
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
What?
Phoebe?
Do I?
We agreed on Minnie.
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Sure. Okay.
You're good. You're good!
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Hey, hey Ross.
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I say, punch him Joey.
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
Bye!
I'll get it.
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Am I too late?!
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Oh, Ross!
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Hi!
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
Tell me.
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No. No, that's- that's okay.
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Monica bang!
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
Hey.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
I'm Amanda.
No, I-I-I gotta go.
My God, you're choking! That better?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
And who is this little cutie pie?
You asked him too?!
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
Why don't we take it for a spin?
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
All right.
Yeah, right.
Surprise!!!
No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
No.
Oh, it's you.
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
Bona sera.
You can have it!
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
Eh.
Why are your eyes so white?
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
And who is your friend?
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
Nothing.
Oh that's so great!
But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Alright.
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Oh Drake.
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
Oops.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
So.
Sure.
Hi, Monica.
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
How did you know?
He's Bobby Bobby?
Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
Thanks.
Great. I'll see you later!
Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Hey Rachel.
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Come on along and listen to...
Okay, now I'm really late.
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
Are you sure?
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
Huh. That's nice.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Whoooaa!
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Hi!
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
Phoebe?
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
That's me.
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
Shhh.
Hola, Joey!
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
You're a big scrud.
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
I'm ready!
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
I want you right here, right now.
Don't, I like it dirty.
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Joey.
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Jack, would you let it go?
Fruitflies?
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
What 'cha doing?
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
I'm right here!!!!
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
Why?!
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Don't, I like it dirty.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Eight! Easy eight.
Hey, buddy.
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Okay, go ahead.
Why?
Very, very bad.
Shut up!
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
C'mon.
Oh please God, let there be a song.
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart?
I didn't realize that she was so close.
How you doin'?
Hey.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
How did you--?
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
You want me to cancel it?
Texas?
But, you left the chair area.
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
Thank you. All right.
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
Yeah.
Oh John! Great!
What do we got there?
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
Yes?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
Where do I know you from?
This hummus is great.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
We really do feel bad about this though.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Hi Rachel!
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
No kidding.
I-I-I don't think so.
Eeeee!
Right.
Yeah! Yes!
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
How are ya man?
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
All right, thank you so much for all your help.
What is going on?!
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
Wow!
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
No! Why?
You picked a great couch.
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
What?
Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
Okay, see ya!
Yes.
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
I'm with Hamilton!
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Yeah, they're not so bad.
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
...Now? Now?
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
Hey Rachel!
I'll take it all.
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Well, up yours too!
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Ah, which ever is closest.
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
No, thank you. Chandler!
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
Okay.
Hello Joey.
Yeah.
Of course I do.
Whaddyou mean?
You wear bi-focals?
Caitlin!
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
Wasn't it?
I'll just throw them out.
She's not here and please come in.
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
We have our babies?
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
I don't have a monkey.
Professor Geller!
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
Hi!
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
And there is Kevin.
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
Why?
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Oh, ok. Alright.
No Santa? Was I bad?
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
I'll take a look at him.
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Scene 5, take 2.
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
No more pranks.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Well, we've gotta go.
We stopped at the gift shop.
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
No, you don't.
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
You did!
No thanks.
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Thanks, any suggestions?
Excuse me?
That's good. Very good!
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
We have got to move!
That would work.
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
Beep!
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Yesss?
A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Yeah! Yeah, we can!
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
It's Erica.
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
That's just the way it is.
Y-, y-, you like that show?
Oh!
Good-bye.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Thank you!
Is it dry in here?
Hmm.
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
Well, that was ah...
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
A real doctor?
Huh?
I can't do that!
All right, on the table.
No! It don't go up on the wall!
Oh I know!!
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.

Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
Gotcha.
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
It was Max's stuff.
Oh! That was Lambchop!
He does that?!
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
What?
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Rach, are you okay?
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
I will.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
Okay.
Ok.
Thats unbelievable.
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Yeah.
You're scratching. Give me the dice.
What's it look like?
What?
Look, I. . .
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Me too.
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Oh, we're not together.
Yeah, I know, I.
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
Oh yeah, of course you don't!
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
I think I lost. Three times.
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Yes?
She's not making me uncomfortable.
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
Screw it! I'm having one.
Yeah, come on in.
That's it. That's my whole name.
I'll check the kitchen floors.
Are they here yet?
Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Twenty-four actually.
'We' would be me and Rick.
No, we are. I'm sad.
No, you can't use your watch.
Then, you're redoing it because...
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Who is it?
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone!
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Look at this.
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
No, but that's bad!
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
Yes it is.
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
Well that's not a third nipple.
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Well, somebody got some last night.
Sorry, what?
Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so...
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Hi, how's it goin?
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
I know. I like it up here.
I came to give you this and this.
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
Yeah!
Okay.
Oh, me too.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
I knew you'd understand.
No, I ahh, had another idea.
Can I please see your face?
Chandler Bing?
Joey!!!
Is this about me taking your watch?
Really?
Umm...
Maybe. Does that scare ya?
Oh really?
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
C'mon hurry, hurry.
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
See you later Rach.
Okay.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
Your turn.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Oh my God!!
Hey Pheebs!
Neither of us like Ross!
Rachel didn't you just light that?
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
But, he told me over the phone.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
No! No!
You don't wanna know.
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
The Waltham Residence.
Kristen.
Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Okay, see ya.
Kitten?
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
What?
Making out in your office.
Twenty percent.
No.
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
And tell him what?
Doctors are wrong all the time.
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Hi!
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
No.
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Hey.
Yeah.
Well have we finished the scene?
In the moment, yeah.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Oh no! Oh no!
Sorry, it's not.
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
Shall we?
Oh-no-no-no-no....
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
It's okay...
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
I can help with that.
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Animal Control.
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Oh, who's this little guy?!
We can't do that.
Welcome to Las Vegas.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Oh hello, Ross.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Kate?
Monica!
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
It's a...
No! They did!
I love you sweetheart.
Hi.
How, how can you be here and there.
Joey!
Yes.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
You owe me a cat.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
Well...
Are you gonna be okay?
Don't do that.
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
You're not wearing the patch yet.
It was you?
No, I think it's cute.
Well, call me if you change your mind.
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
Rachel! Rachel!
Yeah, sure.
Take thee Ross...
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
That won't be necessary.
Awww.
Actually they were Nana's.
Okay! See you later!
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
Ohhh.
Hey!
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
Why, what happened?
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
And what will that be on the side of?
Hey, can I ask you something?
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
What do you see? What do you see?
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
That's not so good.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Yeah?
How are you?
Ok, yeah.
She got a job in L.A.
Would you like to move over to the couch?
Is it bad?
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
Sure!
Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then.
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
Why? So you could hang up on me?
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
Yeah, I'd really like that.
But they're not here yet!
Yeah.
What's up?
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Thank you sweetheart.
All right, fine.
Mark!!
Hi.
Let's go Phoebe!
Okay, well g'night.
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
Hi!
Take thee Ross...
As much as he needs.
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Hi, its us.
Nooo.
You don't like puppies?
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
No.
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.
Are you okay?
Hi.
So...
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
He can have his job back.
It's raining men!
It's for me.
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
Yeah! Yep.
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
What's a matter with you?
She broke my arm.
By being in a box?
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
Any minute now.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
Is she gonna be all right?
Here you go.
Susan! Hi!
Wow! Thanks!
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
Actually, I should get going.
I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
I'll get our seats.
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
OH...MY...GAWD!!
Ohh!
Alright, I'll call you.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Okay, now I've really have to go!
No! I did!
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Crap!!
Now get on out of here, you!
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Yeah. How 'bout that.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
How does it happen?
I'm sorry?
Do I know why we're rushing?
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
Hey!
Oh hey! Here they are!
What?
Oh yeah, aww!
So glad you brought someone.
What?!
Honey, don't bite your nails.
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Five dollars a box.
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
It was, wasn't it?
Get out!
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
So ah, we on for tomorrow?
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Somebody lose a ring?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Who is it?
What does that mean?
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
Ohh, it's time to go.
Wow, love your new nose!
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Daddy cut me off.
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
I-I'm sorry?
Hey Rachel!
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Woah.
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Baby. Ross.
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
I have nothing to do with casting.
So you guys want me to take this back?
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
That's my monkey.
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.
We're getting married!
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Hi.
How are you?
I-I am Kristen.
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Hi darling.
Whad'ya mean no?
See what you did.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
You guys tell them you were married?
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Actually, that's our three hole punch.
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
And cut!
What do you mean, your seat?
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
I could play the oboe!
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
Eww!
Oh.
Hey.
No.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
I got it!
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
What?
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
You can say that again Mac.
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
God! Ross!
Alright, let's take this outside.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Okay.
What?
Is all this true?
Hey.
Really?!
No, please.
Nina.
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Joanna passed away last night.
Good for you.
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
Well, I'm from California.
Oh I...I think they're funny.
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
Oh yeah!
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
You don't secretly smoke do you?
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
You told on us?
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
Just the last two pages.
Really?
I think we're here.
We're gonna give it another try.
But you know what might really cheer me up?
What does he look like?
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
Okay.
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
Wait! Where's my shoes?
This is for the fourth grade.
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Our little boy is getting married.
Scene 5, take 1.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Well, we were...
When's my daddy coming back?
I'm sorry.
That was...so good.
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Hey!
So you like the short hair better.
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Still no smile?
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
That's all!
Next.
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
I will flip you for it.
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
May I help you ladies?
How's it going?
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
That - that's an idea.
Hey, Rach!
Ewww!
Er, yeah, it's mine.
You too.
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Are you?!
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
What?!
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
Hi.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Yeah, but this is
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
Eight whole days.
I thought it was toner.
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
Hey.
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
No I'm not.
Susan and I live together.
Yes!!
What?!
Do you want to know?
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
Still rolling, annnnd action!
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Drake, what're you getting at?
We're baack!
Yeah. Frank.
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
Thanks a million.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
You okay? You all right?
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
But you're not.
We're just friends.
Why would we be freaked?
Hey.
No, they're-they're all true.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
And while we're on the subject of news..
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Oh.
He told on us?
Hi Phoebe.
Uh-huh, yeah.
But Phoebe...
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
No way!
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
We did?
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
Hi.
Who are you talking too?
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
I guess he doesn't know.
Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
What?!
Good bye Ross.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
Dennis.
Bye.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
Uh, no not really. Why?
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
Excuse me.
Oh hey, Pheebs!
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
No, it's you!
I am so attracted to him right now.
Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
Uh, bye Monica.
I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Really?
No, it's-it's Andrew.
Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Well, whatever works for ya...
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
Uh sure.
I should just be happy to be near you.
Hey.
Attack!
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
Yeah, it was.
Anything else?
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
You too.
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
Monana?
So what do you want?
It does sound appealing.
Joey!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
Ross!
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
They have parasites?
What do you need help for?
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Hi!
Umm, no.
It-it's really heavy.
There is a little child inside this man!
Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
So what are you guys out doing today?
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
You're right.
No that's my assistant.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
One second.
Hey!
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
Yeah! Right!
Looks like that might come any minute.
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Yes, it has a head!
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
3-B!
What? Do you think he likes me?
Your license please.
Am I allowed to drink anything?
Mmmm!
What's you point man?
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
I'm Megan Bailey.
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Um, excuse me.
Could ya?
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
Huuh.
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back.
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
Oh, my.
Hi.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Oh great!
I know. That's what I told her.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Yes it does.
It could've been a hair straightener.
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Yes! I have it right here. Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
Thanks for your help.
What?
Ah, you... have the sex?
You did a good thing today.
Okay, I love you.
Ow!!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
I brought you something.
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
Yeah, it sure does.
I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
As in my grandmother.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
That's exactly what my dad used to say!
Hey, we were sitting there.
So uh, here's your office set!
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
He's not here right now.
I can do that.
What's not funny?
Oh that's great! You are the best!
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
Hi! What's going on?
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
I'll be okay.
I thought he was with you.
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
You're so sweet!
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
All right. I'll get my bag.
Cut.
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
Are you yelling at me?!
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
All those things I said about not being ready...
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Hey!
Oh, boy, do they suck.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
I'm, I'm still me.
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
What?
Let it be me! Let it be me!
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
Horrible!
Go! Come on! Roll!
You're doing it again.
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
Your messages have been erased.
It's a lovely apartment.
Hey, be right there.
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
Hi Phoebe.
Hi.
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
What?!
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
So, what's up?
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
What kinda noise?
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
Hey!
Good. Bye!
Um-hmm, five actually.
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
Hey!
Joey, right?
Everybody has to audition.
I wish I didn't have to go.
Alright.
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
Not really.
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Why?
I beg your pardon?
What are you doing here?
Hey!
Hey you guys!
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
Huh? What?
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Well, you were fired.
Oh please, a relationship.
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
So are you his mother or his father?
There's one thing missing.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
Look I just thought that...
Are you alright?
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
And wait, I've got something for you.
No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Can I see your license please?
You were gonna propose?
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
Hey. Hi Phoebe.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
I'll help you dial.
Hi.
Who?
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Yeah, me too.
Also large?
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
Please.
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
Uh, yes.
So.
Were you this cute in high school?
Hello Skidmark.
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Great.
I'll go.
Yes you did! What was it?
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
Nooo!
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
Dysprosium.
Please, let me do something.
A moustache comb.
I love both of you!
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Hi Chandler!
Or so I would have you believe.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Why don't we what?
Oh, good.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
Hi.
What? Oh!
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
What?
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Hi!
Um, cheers.
It looks like her.
Hey!
That's fine, thank you.
Uhh, you said there was a party.
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
Bye.
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
Hi.
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
How are you honey?
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Sharing is good.
Oh, really.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
How, how is this my fault?
Hi, Alan.
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Oh, I spilled some.
Chandler?
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
And I do have one seat left.
Yeah. So how have you been doing?
You were amazing out there.
No, it's really good.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
Let's do this alright.
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
Yeah?
Daryl Hannah.
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
What?
Were you following me?
No you answer it and take pledges.
Um-hmm.
Chandler's a girl!
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
Oh, I love you too. But...
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
What?
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Do you want me to check again?
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
My job!
Okay. You ready to push again?
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
C'mere, Patti.
Hey!
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Yeah?
Chandler?
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Whoa! Ohh!!
Nice to meet you too.
Hi!
She.
You are!
Chandler?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Still no luck.
I can't!!
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Hi, this is Richard.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
Night.
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
Youre kidding? She seems so...
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
So how did you know I was even here?
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Who?
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
Whoa!!
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
Hey.
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
Oh my God, I'm married!
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Nice uh, costume.
That's what we were off doing.
Hey!
He is? Why?
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
I think I need a drink.
This is a great picture.
Monica! Where are you from?
Okay, yeah!
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
I am famished. What do I want...
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
I can still see you!
So ah, what's wrong with him?
You wanted to see me?
I saw Richard.
Rachel!
Help!
Step aside, ladies!
The what?
One more chance Ursula, please?
Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
Ok.
Can he handle the stick?
What?
So. I guess I'll see you around.
That's Hanson.
It's me!
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Hhhhiiiii.
Wait! We need shoes!
You are now.
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
Hey!
Hi!
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Oww!!
Phoebs.
Hi!
I can't do that.
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
Looks good.
You okay?
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Yeah.
This?
Grazie.
Hey, how, how did you do that?
The game is over, we eat now?
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Oh, okay.
Working with blind kids.
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
Rachel?
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
Hi!
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
My parents are dead.
Bon giorno tutti!
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
Yes.
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
Why?
Hello, Chandler.
Is there a problem?
'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
...and this guy...
I don't want you taking that thing.
Uh, sure, why not.
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
Or?
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
That's great! That's wonderful!
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Joey, this is awkward part.
Drops!
Oh that's great!
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Hi.
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
How did you know there was a but?
Why are you so jealous of me?
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Yeah. All right.
Ready?
I know I couldn't. So....
I have a question about this scene.
Okay, we're not.
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
Well, my goodness, what was that?
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Hi.
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
Ohh!!
Drops. Here, they're free.
Monica! What...
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Are you guys ready?
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
Uh, the usher told us to come...
Oh my God!
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
Who's party is it?
Yes?
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
This is from the woman at the bar.
Mon!
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Are you gonna play?
You think?
Well, my nose got lonely.
I don't know.
That'd be great, thanks.
Hey!
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Thanks Phoebe!
Hey!
I'd rather not.
Knick fan?
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk...
...No, we hate him.
Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Because I'm in love with you.
You are mad!
I hate you!!
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
Great. I'll ah, see ya then.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
Oh!
What?
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Yeah.
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.

Hi, Joey.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Wow. He's strict.
Except stilts.
Oh sure. Vince?!
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Hi!
You guys live around here too?
Wow! What an unusual cat!
C'mon, this is us.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
I guess you can.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
She's there?!
Yes.
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
No.
Yeah, whatever.
So how do you kids like your coffee?
No, we just went out.
What?
Yeah?
Bye bye Joey.
Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight.
Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
How are we gonna get out of that one?
Where's your baby?
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
Okay.
What if you put them here.
No suds, no save. Ok?
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
How are you?
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
Never mind, it's open.
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
How's the hired help?
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
Yeah.
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
Hey.
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
What, you don't think I know that?
Well you can split it with another credit card.
Woooo hoooo!!!
Yeah, I heard it.
Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
Ohh, so cute.
Where is this party?
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
You've done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
Hello
Rach! Rach!
See.
Can't hear you!
It's a good play, isn't it?
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
No, I'm picking you up.
Aaawwwwww!!
Really! You-you sail?
I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
Well, this all looks good.
What?!
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
Hey! Hi!
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
You are!
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
You need to get out of my chambers.
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
Become a drama critic!
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
Hi! Remember me?
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
What's with him?
It's not that kind of anniversary.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Come on, touch it!
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
So?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
What a nice story!
Well it's gone.
Uh-oh.
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Are you wearing my glasses?
Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
Maybe in L.A?
Me too!
I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before.
I don't think I should say.
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
I can promise not to tell her again.
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Woo-hooooo!!!!
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
No. You?
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Oh shout, that would have been fun.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Chicken? Chicken boy!
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
No! Sam Waterston!
Excuse me?
How's my Bing-a-ling?
Ding!
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Hey.
Great. That would be fine.
Well, I'll see you later.
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
What is in the cup?!
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Hey!!
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
Which one?
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Okay.
Thing?
I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!
Are you serious?
Professor Geller?
I get that a lot.
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Hi.
Excuse me?
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
You owe me a waffle.
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
8,600.
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
No.
No, I just thought it was cute.
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
You suck!!
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Ross? What's with the neck?
No I didn't.
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Nope.
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Okay uh, however...
Christmas eve.
Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
You really didn't have to. Wow.
Let's show 'em.
Cut!!!!!!!!!!
He painted that.
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Well, she has issues.
And he was my best student.
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
Yeah.
Take thee, Emily...
No. Why?
Oh my God!
You have?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Alright, we'll share.
Nice to meet you Joey.
Hey guys!
Yeah, she was my best teacher.
So, I hear, you hate me!
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
I'm actually the office manager.
Stop saying that. I hate that.
Oh my God!
Wow! Skates!
Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done.
Yeah!
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
That's okay.
Shut up!
What-what are you doing?
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Ok.
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Kristen.
Ross!
Great!
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
He went out for groceries.
Yeah.
What in the name of hell?
Yeah.
Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
October 25th.
Isn't!
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
Uh-huh.
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Oh honey, I'm fine.
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
Really?! You?
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
So, it's great to see ya.
They prefer it if I don't barter.
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
Fellas, these guys were here first.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Really? Then why are you like that?
Good one.
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
I want you to move in with me.
Hi.
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
Bye.
Hey.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Get out.
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
Yeah.
So Santa's coming?
Santa's mad at me.
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
Okay.
Here he comes! Hurry!
Thanks, see you at the party.
She didn't.
You wanna quit?
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!
Just keep smiling.
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
Can I help you?
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
That's why you broke up with me?
You have some life here, sweetie.
She's your partner.
That I was not expecting.
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Woah!
Wow!
Out!
I am Julio.
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
I am gonna try and quit drinking.
Wow!
What?!
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
I live upstate.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
Thanks.
Which one? Which button, Jack.
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
Hi Joey.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
And now you'll see me buying it.
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
Ross, I'm gonna go.
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Hi.
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
You have three new messages.
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
I think we have an answer.
That's the one.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Would you like to call somebody?
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
So.
Sure! That would be nice.
Great.
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?
Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
Fair enough.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
Bye.
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
What?
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Hola! Hello. Hello?
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
You're so bad!
You didn't!
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
I do know.
Oh. Uh, what?
No, pretty much just a towel.
I tell ya a lot things!
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
Definitely.
It's not Rick.
Monica?
That's a good one!
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
You dog!
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Um-hum, you're jealous.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
Monica, wake up. Monica.
Why?
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
No, that was clenching.
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
Hey!
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
So you want to come inside?
I think you've got concussion.
Heavy.
Do you have any tissues?
I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
I'm sorry?
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
What is it, Tim?
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Huh. Yeah?
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
A tad.
You got a problem with that?
No.
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
Oh, yeah!
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
I'm already here.
Then uh, what's-what's this?
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
Oh my God.
You too.
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
Ahh.
Good to see you too!
Well, what was supposed to happen?
What do you mean?
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
So. How'd you guys meet?
No.
Yeah! Punch him!!
I feel good! ...Who are you?
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
Surprise!
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
This is really hard for me to say.
Hey.
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
OK, everyone gather up.
It's open! Come in!
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
For what?
Ohhhhh!
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
Uh-huh.
Good luck! Go get 'em!
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
What about my friend Victor?
Aaaaah!
I!
Rough numbers?
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Why?
Oh!
Well yeah!!
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Yeah, really.
Joey!
So, Monica, what do you do?
You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
Morning!
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
I love that idea!
Awwwwwwww.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
I was just being polite, but, alright.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
So... they sss-still seem normal.
Hey.
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
Are you remaking the bed?
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
My what?
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Hi.
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Hey!
Charlotte who?
God. I love you.
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Oh, thanks.
Oh. Good to see you guys.
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
Oh, hi Rachel.
What, look back?
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
What?
I'm pregnant.
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
I'm not all right.
No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
So, see ya on Saturday.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Sure.
Oh my God! It didn't remind you of...
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
Oooooo....
Nobody sees the king!
Well, what do you want me to say?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Hey!
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
So! How's the library?
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
Honey, you are in it.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Oh good.
Oh.... my.... God.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
I know! I can't wait!
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
It's my baby too.
Rach! Come on! Rach!
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I'll see you later?
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
What?
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
Hi!
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Oh! Yeah!
It's not here.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Why not?
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I'll be there.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Umm.
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Yeah, is she really 20.
Umm, Frank Buffay.
Nora!
Really! You got a place upstate?
Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
So, have you kids eaten yet?
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
That's terrible! I'm sorry!
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
Okay.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh-no.
So, so, did you hear?
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Hello!
Oh my God, Phoebe.
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
But...
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
Who?
It's uh, $12.50.
Yeah, but you didn't.
Mm-hmmm
Bye Phoebe.
Y!
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
Absolutely!
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
So, so youre here too?
Well ah, what can you swing?
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Then, what's the problem?
Thomas, come back here!
Ross, are you okay?
Is this true?
Chandler.
What's the matter?
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
Who are you?
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
Ditto.
What'd I get?
I like Ben.
Yeah, what's the gala for?
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
All right.
Oh my God!
Hey Joey! We're ready.
Oh please!
Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
So how did everything go?
Normal.
Oh, sorry!
Fabulous.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
Yeah, sure.
Are you Chandler?
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Oh hi!
Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
I am Father Kalebasous.
Cut! Wonderful!
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
What is it?
We're so sorry.
Humm, really?
Stay well.
What?
I'm wearing two belts.
Was it her quarter?
Okay.
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
Sign here.
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
Hey guys!
Tell her what?
No.
I found the picture!
Would you.......Would you hug me?
Me.
Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Checking to see if it's even.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
Of course.
Ohh. Ouch.
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
Hi Phoebe.
Breathe.
I was gonna say...
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
I'm not coming back.
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
Well, people!
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
Me neither.
Great!
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
No, no, no.
Your mother just added him to her list.
How long do you want the cuffs?
Yes.
Yeah, isn't that great?
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Philadelphia.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Count faster.
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Great!
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
I missed this.
No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
I think you may have a drinking problem.

We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
We're ok.
I believe you know my husband.
If that helps you.
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
You would think.
You wanna touch it?
Oh!
Even if he were... cornered?
8!:
What?!
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Hey guys!
You did it twice?
So that's your second marriage in two years.
So, what did Francis leave me?
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together.
This could've been hers!
And could I get my ring back?
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
I-I'll call ya.
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Bing!
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
No.
Cut.
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Yeah, could you scooch?
Gary.
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Yeah!
Nothing?
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
How can I help you?
Monana was very brave.
A bitch?
No, I don't know him.
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
Oh man!!
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Elizabeth!
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Obviously.
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
Hello!
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
Yeah, big fan.
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
Heh... y'know?
Bye.
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Hi, I'm Maria.
We could write it down for you?
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less...
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
Is there a Julio here?
Oh, yeah!
Remoray!
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
You make me laugh.
Cool! I-I'll see you then.
Hey, Pheebs.
Very bad!
Hello.
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
Oh, great! Me too.
Hi, Ross.
You too sweethart!
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Over a month.
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Maybe I should go!
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
You told me you didn't see anything.
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Oh, you forgot?
Oh, look at that.
...and live forever as a machine!
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hello?!
Sorry Phoebs.
COME ON!!!!
You're dying?!
No you do. You... just...
Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
Well, you never told me how old you were.
So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
It's the basketball playoffs.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
What? Is it my breath?
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Really. What?
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Hey! You can't go back there!
Dude!
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
You look beautiful this evening.
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
Uh-oh.
You okay, kiddo?
Good morning Rachel.
Yes I did.
Ross.
May I help you?
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
Take thee, Emily...
Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
I sure did!
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Yay!
All right, it's time to act, my talking props.
Yeah, move over just a little bit.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Hey Joey.
Absolutely, yeah!

Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Hey!
Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Where are they?
Bye.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
Bye-bye.
Hey, where's his thing?
Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
Glad to be of help. Matches.
You?
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Just give me a chance too...
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.
Ohh!
Oh!... Right!
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Yeah.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Two.
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Where can I wash up?
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Right.
Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Hi.
You know what makes the itching even worse?
It's me.
Hi!
Fine. I don't like you!!
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Oh?
Maybe you should.
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
The receipt.
I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
Great!
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
Is this yours?
Okay, Santa!
Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
Yeah, we are.
I'm so sorry!
Okay! Okay!
Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
Come on! Speech!
This should be fun.
Pleasure.
Oh, maybe that's it.
That was great, the kids loved you.
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Okay. Bye.
She what?!
I'm a little embarrassed.
Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
It's good to see you.
Gloves?
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
You got married again.
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
Well...
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
It can do this.
Hey!
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
Oh, that's great.
That's okay.
Why the Post?
You have a son?
Everything.
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
Can I get you some coffee?
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
All of them.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
Did you cut this couch in half?
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Eeaagh!
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
What do we got here?
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
Well, in a nutshell. . .
We don't need any toner.
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Yeah, yeah, maybe.
I'm not allowed to have soda.
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
It doesn't say that in the script.
Damnit!
No, it really should be burgundy.
Yeah...
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
What's the matter?
Lebanon.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
Yes.
Hey! What's going on?
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Okay.
What kind of surgery?!
I'll never forget you.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
Oh?
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
There you go.
Rachel Green's office.
I'm Marjorie.
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
M!
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
I wasn't invited.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
I-I do though.
Hey.
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Yes.
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Come on in.
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
Oh.
Aah!
Ok.
And the spitting?
Fine.
Mr. Geller.
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
You mean like exclusive friends?
Ciao, bela.
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
You're right. Of course you're right.
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Is this guy great or what?
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
They all had a thing for him.
It isn't.
beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
What do you need from the car?
Take care.
Happy birthday sweetie.
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
I am?
She took all my stuff.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
Hey.
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
Right. Could you sign this?
Well someone does.
Well, if you don't, I will.
I'm kidding!
Chandler?
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
Hey.
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Ready, Annabelle?
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
What?
You are playing American football?
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
Oh, I got that for him.
My parents are going to be really mad.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Hey!
All right. Bye.
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
I'm sorry.
More wine, dear?
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
