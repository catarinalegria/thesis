She's a waitress.
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Rach?
Hey.
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
No.
Right, like the kind you...
Oh good.
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
All right, what's going on there?
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Yeah?
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
I can hop.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
How can you not know which one?
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Well, what period is it from?
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Hey!
Oh!
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Your nails.
What does the sign say?
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Y'know what that means?
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
No-no! I-I...I found one.
OK.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Here we go.
Yeah.
Hi Emily!
No.
Ooh! Brian's Song!
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Ugh, okay Sherlock!
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Joey.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Oh, I see.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Oh, yeah, right.
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
I know. This is really, really huge.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Why?
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Ugh, what's right with them?
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Well, can you dance at all?
Nice try.
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
Oh me too.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Oh you are so lucky.
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
Hey.
I know.
Ok, that's so nice.
I don't get it.
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!

Hey, dude!
You really thought it was perfect?
All right all ready.

Yeah Im fine.
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
Yeah!
What?
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
We could not, would not want to wait.
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
You missed a belt loop.
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
So that story doesn't make you cry?
Now what is Fabutec?
Oh.
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
No!
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Ross!
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
I could do that.
No listen to me! She is crazy!
Ok.
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Radiator.
I got it! Mine!
Oh my God, you look so good!
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Totally.
I've had better.
Garfunkle.
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Um you, you got a minute?
No!
Hi.
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
I am.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
I hope it's you.
Hey.
Okay.
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What were you doing?
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Hmm?
Sure! Where is it?
What?!
And who else is going to be there?
Yeah.
Hi.
Fish!
You guys!
No, I can spot you from here.
You just said...
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Oh, me too!
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
Yeah, kinda.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
I love the license plate game!
What?!
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Oh yeah, come here.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
So talk to her.
Yeah! You're the best!
'Cause that's just your taste.
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Oh, I get a puppy!!
Ah!!
Hey!
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
No!
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Noooo!!
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Okay. See?
Then don't touch one!!
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Yeah. Okay.
What?
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
and...
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
What?!!
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
Six months.
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Really?
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Yeah.
What did he say?
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Ugh, I hate this year!
Yeah!
Ooh! Oh!
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
That's not mine.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Bye!!!
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
We should do something. Whistle.
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Hey, Monica!
Yay!
Oh Willie's still alive!
Chandler!!
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
The little jail between the doors!
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Wash your hands!!!
Hey!
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
There you go.
Oh! You have a window!
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Hey!
What I said you had...
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Hey!
Oh, sweetie, oh.
Thank you.
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Oh yeah, so you know D?
That is so sweet, you guys.
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Hi!
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
Yes, I will tell her.
He shot a bird!
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
This is so cool!
Hi!
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Oh my God! That's David!
Nooo!!
Oh, okay, oh.
Shiny.
That might work!
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
What?!
Secret affair!
Yes! Very good.
Rach, you're in my seat.
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Hellooo!
Open bar!
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Okay.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Yeah.
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Oh, I'll get it.
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Hey.
DANGER!!!!!
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Yeah?
Because she's your lobster.
You got me.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
All right, get a room.
Please!
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Definitely.
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Nothing, nothing.
Oh yeah?
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
I won! I won! I finally won!
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
No, nothing.
No that is the last thing you want to do!
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
No. Why?
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
It's not that bad.
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
There's sooo much you don't know.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
No, but you can't.
John?
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
Nothing! This is not over!
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
So did Heldi show you the place?
I saw it.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
What's a Movement class?
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Just kidding. Ahh!
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Oh my God Ross!!
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
He broke that.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Good idea!
You know who shaved you? That was me.
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Mailbox.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
I know what time you said.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
Yeah?
Well then I think that's it.
Go for it.
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
Hey! Oh!
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Hi.
Ohh, get a room.
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
Because I cared enough to lie!
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Hey!
Okay. Well there's one down.
Come in.
What?
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
That's so sweet.
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Duly noted.
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
And this is Rachel.
Thanks! Okay.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
All right. Bye bye.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
I might have.
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Uh-huh.
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Shh! Get me out of here.
Definitely!
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.
Joey's!
Yes!!! Oh!!
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
M-M-Mole people?
Umm, yeah! Today's.
Oh, it's like a skit.
Bye!
Got it.
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
We're all right.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
I'll get it.
I mean this poor woman.
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
Guys, I'm happy too.
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Hi...
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Yes, please.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
Okay, bye!
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
I guess it was kinda funny.
Oh that's not so bad.
Yeah, welcome.
Great! Thank you very much.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Hey!
On a totally different bet.
Oh yeah, like you never called!
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Um, not even a little bit.
Thanks!
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
Me too.
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
We thought you knew!
Bye.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Uh.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
I'm totally getting it!
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Oh yeah!
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Right.
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Are you okay?
No.
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Alright, whadyou do with him?
I can't!!
So?
Yeah, yeah!
Hey.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
OK, hi again.
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
I have plans.
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Oh, so, how are we doing?
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Hi.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
You've never asked a guy out?!!
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Just get your nails done?
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
What?
Ok, have a good break-up.
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
What?!
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
You told them he was missing?
Ohhh!!!
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
But she just came up here!
Hey!
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
You're-you're what?!
Oh Ross, hi.
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
No! Coins hate me!
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
Have you seen your guy's body?
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Lilly's dead.
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Hey.
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
I don't....
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Woo-yay!!
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Why do you care?
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Everything you've heard is true.
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
Oh my God!
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?

Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Whoo-hoo!
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Hi!
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
All right, and umm...
No, you have to let me in right now!!
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Or, or the rodeo!!
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
Why?
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Oh, yeah. What's this?
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
No, not the used wax.
Nu-uh!
Hi Joey.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
Okay, your highness.
I want to see what he wants first.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Yes, good! Ok...
So when, when do you leave?
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Oh no.
Oh.
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Ohhh.
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Excuse me, is this your car?
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
You didn't tell her did you?
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Rachel?
If she says no, can I have the ring?
Knock, knock, knock.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
Oh, is the play over?
What is it?
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
Ooh, erotiery!
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
Ok, all done.
Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
You said it was okay!
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
He's even kind of cute.
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Hi, Max!
Hey!
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Yeah! Okay.
Show me the badge again.
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
'Kay, put your head back.
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
I love Vegas!
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
Yeah.
You're all invited to bite me!
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
How did that happen?!!
Hey nice boobs.
Oh, oh! It's on again!
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
Right, and its me.
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
Why?
Ewww!!!
Oh, thats good.
Uh-hmm.
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Isn't he great?
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
Potato, Potaato.
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Nice!
Oh.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
I know!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Does that mean Carcass is available?
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
So good!
Why?
I want to keep one.
No! I do want to!
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
Just for a second.
Hi.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
No. But thanks.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
I'm pretty.
Wow. Thank you.
Maybe there's someone else.
Yeah, coffeehouse.
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Such a pig!
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
It's not that bad.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Well, I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
What, that's it?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Yeah.
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Are you crazy?
Maybe it was the guy.
where were you standing?
I sang. Hah!
Oh, fine! Take his side!
Why?
You're there!
Wh-why is that the best part?
That is a different phone.
It's okay to laugh right?
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Well, then...Let's.
You guys. You suck too.
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
Ok. One.
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
I found it!
Really?! What's your name?
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
None the less.
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Going to the hospital tonight?
Hello?
Oh my God!
What happened?
Okay, quit down.
So, did you pick one yet?
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
I guess.
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
I don't know. Me neither.
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Yeah.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
Yes! Oh no!
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.
Ross, where did you get this?!
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
Hm-mmm.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
Okay, Widow!
Hey!
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Okay, woo! Hi.
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Mr. President.
Wow!
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Oh!!
I'm sorry.
No. I've learned my lesson.
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Oh, I couldn't go in.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
John Glenn is here?!
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Central... Park!
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Of course!
Oh, right!
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
Umm, no thank you.
What?
Oh.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
Marcel?
Oh, look what we almost left.
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
You mean a backup?
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Good choice.
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
What kind of an emergency?
You guuuyys.
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
I'm sorry.
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Doing it on this table.
Yeah!
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
Oh, it's not!
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
He just got a divorce right?
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Oh, they love your casserole.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Oh, poor baby.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
Say we are unagi!
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
You wanna try it again?
That oughta do it.
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Okay.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Oh my God!
Could you speak up please?
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Uh-huh.
What?
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
What are you talking about?
Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
Ow! Ow!
Yeah, totally.
Oh! Yeah!
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Thanks.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Oh God, absolutely.
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Don't even get me started on yours!
Then why did she ask us to...
A birthday party.
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Hey cool, mine too.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
And-and you're using my name!
That's right.
Oh that's right!
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Oh hey! How was your audition?
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
Oh!
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
Wow.
Are you still mad at us?
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
You can't have sex with her!
And call me!
God, Susan is so fun!
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Oh.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
I miss you too!!!!
Eww!
Okay.
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Yeah, no, it was great.
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Ok, thanks.
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Okay.
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Oh, you just know.
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Well, just buy the damn boat!
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Shut up!
Oh, that is better.
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
But I can't tell you.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Much as you are.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Hey.
Oh, thanks!
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
