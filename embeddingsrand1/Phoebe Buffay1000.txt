What, what is that?
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Hey!
Oh that's not so bad.
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
Oh-my-God!
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Yay!!
Yeah! You're the best!
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
That's him.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Uh-hmm.
Ooh!
Ohhh!!!
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Okay, um, stay.
Okay.
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
Or you could end up with everything.
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Yeah.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Congratulations!
Knock, knock, knock.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Hello.
Why? Why would you do that?
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
It's nice that he has someone.
Hey!
Okay.
Okay. Bye!
Oh hi!
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
What?!
Who's Barney.
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
That's too hard. Too hard!
What?!
Umm, Gene.
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
That chick can't handle my corner.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Yeah, totally.
Oh yeah.
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Hey!
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
What is it?
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
Oh, hi.
Did he mention us?
All right, what's going on there?
What happened?
Okay.
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
No!
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Two.
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
What does the sign say?
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
I could've been killed I hope you know!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
Well... It's a date.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Uh-huh.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
I-I-I found it interesting.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Oh my God!
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Oh, we killed them all.
What?
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Oh, okay.
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
I think on some levels she already knows.
Oh, Rachel.
Yeah?
Hey.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Ohh!
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
That's not good.
Sing!!
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Monica, in or out?
So tell me about this girl?
So you're not homesick yet?
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
It could be like a big giant guy.
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
I miss Rose.
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Go for it.
Chandler, Chandler.
How'd you know I was coming?
Nothing. Nothing.
No, I think you should tell them.
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
That might work!
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
What?!
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Yeah Im fine.
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
I don't know.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
We want you to marry her!
Uh... yay!
And this is Rachel.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
No. No food with a face.
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Fine!
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Ugh, okay Sherlock!
What were you thinking?
Okay.
I want to keep one.
Still.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
So, what movie should we see?
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Hey.
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
No that is the last thing you want to do!
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Okay, there.
Ben, dinner!
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Hey!
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
Yeah.
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
Oh yeah, right now.
Oh.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Thank you.
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
I'm totally getting it!
Hey!
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Okay!
Rachel said that!
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Rachel? Um, hi.
I'll have coffee.
Ohh, impressive.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Hey!
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
She is gonna hate me.
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Oh my God!
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
please...
Hey.
Ooohh, why?
No. But thanks.
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
So that story doesn't make you cry?
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Rachel has a new doll.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
You said I was boring--Ohh!
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
YOU KNOW?!!!
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Well, yeah.
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
The name was my favourite part!
Oh.
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
What?
Oh, sly.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Ahh, his work is done.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Hey!
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Oh my God!!
You too!
No! Coins hate me!
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Bye!
How'd he take it?
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Hi!
Why?
How many beeps?
Oh, hello liar.
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
I could do that.
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
But why does it even matter?!
Oh yeah.
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
What's block?
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
No!
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Uh huh. Why is that?
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Okay, Widow!
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
What is that?
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Why would you kill his fish?
Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Sure!
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
My Saturn dealership.
Not that often!
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Dance karate?
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
What I said you had...
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Yeah?
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
That won't go with this dress though.
And who else is going to be there?
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
You have chalk on your face.
Where's Chandler?
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Going to the hospital tonight?
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
I love this game!!
Hey.
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
God, what happened?!
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Yeah?
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
What the hell are you doing?!
Janice? You called Janice?
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Yeah.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
I'm having my first contraction!
No, not the used wax.
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
You have your birth certificate?
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Oh.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Yay!
What are you doing here?
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Good idea!
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
What, that's it?
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
I'm gonna get coffee.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Hey, why don't you?
I got it! Mine!
They have the best stuff in there.
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Great!
Na-uh, I am!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
Maybe on some level.
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
What make you think I can?!
Oh! Yeah!
Watch, watch.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Living with you would make me happy.
Okay!
Hey Joey.
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
I, OK....
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
All right. Bye bye.
What-what are you talking about?!
Oh, like that's a word.
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
He's even kind of cute.
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Hey!
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
I don't think you mean that.
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Yeah.
How can you not know which one?
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Yes, good! Ok...
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
We ruined everything.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Good choice.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
What? You mean behind my back?
I don't want to hear about her!!
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Yeah.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Oh.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Okay.
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
What is this?
Hi, so what happened?
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Oh, okay.
So how are things going with Paul?
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Marcel?
Okayyyyy, open up!
Because I think it means more to you.
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
I can hop.
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Oh! What is that? What is that?
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
There he is!
No, whatever! Anything!
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Who the hell are all these people?
You're right.
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
That's right.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
I know.
Really?
What are you saying I should do?
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Uh-huh, yeah!
Chandler.
Um, not even a little bit.
See, we don't need them.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
Thank y...
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
I'm in.
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Oh he's like a...
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
What else do they add smell too?
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
What are you talking about?
Okay, I'm ready.
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
You guys, he's beautiful!
I know where Minsk is.
Ohhh.
Why? What happened now?
No, Joey.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Okay!
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Aww, good. What?
And a glass of tepid water.
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Get in here!!!
Just kidding!
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
What?!
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
No!
Yeah.
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Well, actually it's just from me.
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Nooo! Why would you think that?
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
You know he's gay?
Guys, I'm happy too.
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Yeah, I think we are.
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Oh my God!
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
You wanna try it again?
All right, so let's switch.
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
I'm still on "no."
Does it look like a urinal?
Do it do it do it!
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Ohh-oh, chilling!
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
Ewwww!!
Good! Good! Five points!
Oh my God!-Eh! Well...
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
Oh, thats good.
Hey!
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
Why not?
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
Ok, thanks.
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Hey.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Sorry.
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Hi!
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Why do you care?
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
If!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
Hey.
Yeah. What?!
I don't even know how that would work!
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
He could be in disguise, y'know.
It is your office.
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
What makes it pilgrim?
Oh.
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Yeah!
Bye!!!
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
She sells drugs to kids.
Ok.
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Please.
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Well...
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
But if...
Susan, he looks just like you.
Ohh, ohh.
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
How do you know about this?
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
Oh!
Sure!
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
'My scones.'
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
You just said...
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Why?!
Nothing, nothing.
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Because she's your lobster.
What'd I say?
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
Already?!
What?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
Hm?
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
That's a bird?
Hi Joey.
Say what?
Can I tell you a little secret?
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
Yeah.
Well, I am.
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Me too! So happy for them!
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Then do Iceberg!
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Oh, so, how are we doing?
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
Well then I think that's it.
So how did you know Francis?
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Is it a meatball sub?
Hey!
Thanks! So are you.
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
No, why?
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
God, I hope they kick his ass!
How's this?
Floopy?
So, um, are you gonna call him?
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Hey!
All right.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
I know. They were mine.
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
How long has it been since you had sex?
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Hey cool, mine too.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
Oh no! Why?
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Morly Safer.
Wait!
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Ewwww!!
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Thank you.
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
What?
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Ahhh!!
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Hey.
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
Uh-hmm.
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
So, did you pick one yet?
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Uh, here. What time?
Your own boat?
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Yeah!
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
I think she's OK.
I got no sleep last night!
Me?!
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
It's...
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
Who, Josh?
One of the babies is kicking.
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Oh!!
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
Okay.
Oh, that sucks!
He's so funny!
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Yeah, that'd be ok.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
G'night, bro.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Drum roll.
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
Oh my God.
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Oh... Milwaukee.
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
A birthday party.
Hey!
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Hey!
Hey.
I see.
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Oh no.
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
I might have.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
I know!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Oh, okay, oh.
Okay. No. But thanks.
I'll give you $1 for them.
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
So?
What?
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
Oh good!
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Give it.
Well, he didn't tell me.
Yeah, maybe.
Here.
What are we going to do?!
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Hey.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Okay then.
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
It's okay. How's the soup?
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Oh. Uh, I'm on.
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
But I already gave them back to you!
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Um, cake.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
Oh God, absolutely.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
So, here we are. Nervous?
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Oh God!
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Well, it does.
Yeah.
I'm talking about massages.
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
No. Why?
Thanks Monica!
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Me too.
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Yeah, we went shopping!
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
What?! What the hell?!
You're Frank Buffay?
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Hi! Wish me luck!
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Ohh.
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
Just, you know, to see... um.
I'm done now.
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Hey!
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Finger sandwiches and tea.
Remembered what?
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
Okay.
They're gonna call her Chandler.
