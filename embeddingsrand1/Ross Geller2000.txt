Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Buy mommy.
So uh, have a great time down there.
Bye.
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Oh-ooh!
Damn!
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Hi.
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Hey, don't we have to...
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
I'm gonna be on TV!!
What happened?
Hey, Joey.
You got ink on your lip.
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Mon?
Chandler-
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
You told her!
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Hi honey, how did it go?
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
Sexy?
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
No?
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
You're bleeding.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
You can totally, totally live on this.
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Give me two.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
Huh. This is nice.
Yeah, huh.
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
What?!
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Yeah.
At the vet.
Mon?
You got me a cola drink?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
Hey!
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
That was good.
What?
Five letters.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
I would say that.
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Hi.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Spiderman?
Nooooo!
Excuse me?
Ok.
What's wrong with people having sex?
And the place looks so nice!
Yeah.
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Chandler-
And bus.
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
I can do that.
Do they wait for me to do this?
I Ross...
You okay?
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
What?
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Not on you! On the stripper!
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Zoo dollars?
What happened? Joey?
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
Hmph.
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
What?!
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Oh! No-n-
Great to see you!
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Hmm.
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Yeah!
If only he were a woman.
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
No, we're not.
Is that what I want?
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Sorry.
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
How about you?
Hello.
Hi.
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
FINE BY ME!!
A-A day.
Okay.
Easy.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Emily!
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Monica!
I'm gonna tell Mom.
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Shut up.
Hey guys!
I know.
Hey, there.
Hey!
I am, uh, I am...
I know. I know.
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Yeah!
Yeah, no problem.
Guess who?
It's just I miss her so much.
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Hmm-Hmm.
Which one was that?
Joey, we just saw it!
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
Yes!
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Okay, it's not, it's not.
There you go. Thank you!
Step back.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Ohh, what's wrong?!
What, uh... what juggling thing?
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Hi!
I know.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Yep?
Come on! Come on. Come on.
Who is Maria?
What?
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
I wasn't talking to you.
No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Yeah.
Oh, what? What-what?
Hey, what's going on?
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
I made fun of his accent.
It's a great class.
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Everybody smile.
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Hi!
I know.
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
No, why?
You're over me?
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
What?
Great!
Seven.
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
150 dollars.
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
It was, it was her voice.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
Look, you wanna get off my back?
What?
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well....
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Who's Chip?
Bye.
What's a koondis?
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
I can handle the stick!!
Hi.
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Yeah!
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
You do Pheebs?
What am I looking at?
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Yeah.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Ssshh.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Are you not seeing him anymore?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Joey's not going.
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Well, hello Rachel!
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Yeah, it really was!
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Are you sure?
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
Why aren't you guys dressed?
May I come in?
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Hey does anyone have any gum?
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
So we should probably get going soon.
All right! I want my key back!
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
You took my watch?
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
Oh God, here we go!
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
What's a scrud?
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Why? Why can't you go to him?
I think he can be.
Yeah.
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Pretty soon I guess.
Thank you!
Sure, I-I-I...
I think Chandler's gone.
This one?
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Hey!
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
What is this?!
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Ah! Oh.
Yes, yes, that's right...
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Yeah.
I don't want to do that.
Hey, someone order a coat?
What?! Give-give me a brush.
It was a dry day.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Emily?!
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
Yeah! Got it!
No, I've looked everywhere!
Fine. I'll go.
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Ross, wants a pajmena?
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Yeah!!
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Just, y'know out.
You're on!
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
What? You have a date? Who with?
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
What's going on?! That's what's going on!!
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
Ok, got the vent open.
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Tonight.
Hi, Mrs. Green.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
And he's, he's a total stranger?
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
What are you saying?
Oh.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
I guess so.
She's not even here yet.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
Well, uh.
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Yeah.
Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
Honey, I love you too.
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
All right.
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
It tastes like feet!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Actually, it looks really good.
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
I need juice! People need juice!!
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
You, you go long.
C'mere, Marcel.
What woman?
Ohh!
Okay, sure.
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Thanks.
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
You're gonna be an aunt.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
I could, yeah, I can do that.
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
You wanna explain that?
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Thanks.
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
We were on a break!
Wow, how many have you got?
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
You did it, man.
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
Nope.
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Are you guys sure about this?
Oh.
No, I can't get it out.
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
That's okay, Joe.
Thank you.
And now you want that money back.
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
It does not!
No?
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
We'll be starting with apples.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Rach, have you never done this before?
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Dude, we were good!
What'd you do, take him whaling?
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Yeah.
What?
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
Ah, which, which one?
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Dr. Franzblau, hi.
So I nodded off a little.
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
You're livin' the dream.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Yeah?
Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
What do you like better flora or fauna?
Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
I couldn't.
Okay.
Nice shades.
All right, did you just say all right?
FINE BY ME!!
I'm starving!
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
You're right, you're right, it is.
Hi Jill.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
I am very...very sorry.
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
Hi.
Argh!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, yeah.
Rach!
What?! How's that?
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Ewwww!!
I can't believe that didn't work!
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Okay, quick and painful.
What? Your-your list?
Hi!
Guess what?
Totally.
You know what I like most about him, though?
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Will you-will you please?
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Hi.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Okay, you go grab it!
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
Hey, honey.
What?
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
What happened?
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
All right.
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
So you do know a little English.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Ohh, it was the best!
Phoebe that's not true.
No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
I got it!
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Let me see that! Oh man!
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Okay.
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
The way he makes me feel about myself.
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Over here.
Come on.
Need some help?
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
I love you.
Hey!
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Hey!
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
He gave me a pill for it.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Okay, you are totally making this up.
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
I know.
Ohhhh...
Come on, they're gonna love you.
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
Hi!
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Okay.
You're right!
Monica!
This is unbelievable.
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Yeah.
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
2:17.
No, no, we won't.
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
No you don't.
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Ahhhh!!
Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Where's Ben?
Wow!
Ooooohh!
Ow!!
Well, but, but. . .
Hey.
Go Joe!!!
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
You still love me?
Wow!
I love it, when we share.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
Here's my retainer!
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
It's the off light. Right Ross?
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Oh, I was unbelievable.
Oh my God..
MY SANDWICH?!!!
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Hey.
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
I don't see why not.
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Try telling my wife that.
Hey!
What?
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
That word was swans.
Alright, shall we?
You are? Me, too!
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
What??
Hey!
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
No. no.
Must pee.
Burt!
Hey!
Then don't do that, alright?
Yeah.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Okay. Um, how about these?
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Is this about Mark?
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Wow! Yeah!
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Hi!
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Happy to.
Dad?
Who the hell is Jordie?
Yeah, you're right.
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Can I ask you somethin'?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Hi. She said yes.
Oh, absolutely!
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Oooooh.
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
The test is ready.
Uh fellas,
Oh come on, not again.
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
No.
She's talking.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
That's okay.
Where in Cuba?
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Really?! We are?
Umm, she kissed me.
.....Hi.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
Hey!
You all right?
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
I know.
I suppose.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Toilet paper?
Cool!
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Dude.
Thanks.
No! That's-that's my arm!
Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
In London!
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Oh, you and me?
I, Ross...
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
Not for the next few minutes.
I don't know. What's in this pie?
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Breathe.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Chandler!
No no, that's me.
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
I know.
Sorry.
Press the button.
When?
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
What?
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
Thank you, thank you.
No, but. . .
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Well...
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
How's my little boy?
That's what?!
I know. I am, I am so sorry.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Hey Rachel.
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Hey, save us some pizza.
I have a bone to pick with you.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Look, they must be stopped!
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Are you kidding?!
Hey!
No but, no but.
So, we're off.
Nu-uh!
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Excellent!
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Actually, no, we're not.
Where ya goin'?
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
What?! Why?!
Mmmm.
Oh, forget it, okay?
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Yeah?
One more day, seriously/
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Hey!
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
....and....
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Oh no, not yet.
Thanks!
Well, why're you all dressed up?
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Until now.
What is that?
Why not?
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
No! Why?
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
No kidding?
Okay. Sometimes I feel...
Yeah.
Okay.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
I know!
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Yeah.
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
No! I balanced my checkbook.
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
Turn.
Now, we'll see.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Come on.
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
Hi!
Get married.
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Are you out of your mind?
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Hey.
Great, how did it go?
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
All right.
How sad are we?
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Phoebe.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
Yeah!
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Same difference.
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
I don't know you guys.
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Ahh.
Oh. Uhh...
I am sorry, Chandler.
What are you doing?
Phoebe!
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
How's the hair?
Yeah?
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
What?!
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!
Ross.
Huh.
Yeah, okay.
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
Okay, okay, what's going on?
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Hey!
Sure, do whatever you want.
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Huh?
Oh. And what do you call that?
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Ooohhhh!!
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Why?! Why on the lips?!
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Oh, who? Me?
Hi Jill!
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
That is so made up!
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Hey!
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
You'd wait?
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
She's doing her laundry.
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Excuse me.
What? Let me see.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
She is a kook.
Break!!
Tell me about it.
Hi, is Rachel there?
I'm still hungry!
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
You ah, wanted to see me?
Isabella Rosselini.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's also get a hot plate!
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
I am now.
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Well, I said it loud.
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Hey.
Yeah!
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
Baking it didn't help, huh?
Done! With time a-to-spare.
You're not a lefty?
Go, go, go!
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
And we didn't have sex.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
The volcano?
Okay, let's go!
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
Hi, honey.
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
....I have to go to China.
Marcel?
Divorced men's club.
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Uh.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Sure. Joey...
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
What big thing?
She lent me an egg once.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
What did you get?
Hi.
Umm...
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
Monica! Would it?
Fascinating.
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
But you already told me everything.
Oh my God! Monica!
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
How did he do this?
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
About the yelling.
Joey!
Excellent, that was excellent.
Ahh.
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Hey!
What?!
Rach! Rach!
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
What?
Hi.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Excuse me?
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
No.
What?
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
I know.
Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
What's-what's the difference?
Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
Yes, I do.
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Do you say this stuff to girls?
What? What's on your shoulder?
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Okay.
OK. I'm in my apartment...
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Yeah.
You tell them to wait!
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Pshhshhh!
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
That was different!
I'm getting married, to..day!!
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
I-I, did that for you.
That's what you said last night.
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
You have to respect the sea!
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Hi Janine!
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
What?!
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
She does want to.
Us too.
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
My God Monica!!
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Ohh! Thank you.
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Bye guys.
There we go. All better.
I don't know what to say.
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
Hey man.
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Yes, we have to tell her!
What?
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Yes, you can, very much.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Funny story!
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
...and I really think it should be me.
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Yeah, make that three.
OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
Okay! Hey!
Five.
We're fine, we're fine.
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
That's correct. Ladies?
These-these are beads of joy.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Right.
Uh, hello!
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
Hey!
Yeah.
Dude!
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
A basket of mini-muffins.
Yes I am.
Yeah?
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
this summer?
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Yeah?
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
It's over.
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Okay!
Aqui est.
Hello.
We're really gonna do this, huh?
No way.
What?
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
What?
Hey everybody!
Okay.
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
Oh yeah, I'd love that.
Get out.
We can't do it again.
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Cool.
What?
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
Hi.
You had fantasies about Emily?
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
No?
Why did you hate me?
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Why do they keep doing that?
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Doctor Burke is sexy?
It wasn't the best.
Hmm.
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Come on, would you grow up? It's no big deal.
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
What? That's impossible.
Hey!
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Hey! Hi!
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Wh- are you welling up?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
I-I-I...
Yeah sure.
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Yeah.
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
Sure. I'll help you.
Well. Hey...
No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
Sure, what's up?
Well...
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
Hi Pheebs!
Okay!
Hey! Are you ready yet?
Hey guys!
Twice.
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
So what's it shaped like?
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
What?
Look, I do not re-love her.
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Rach!
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Is this about Mark?
With such a sad history.
That is what the thing is.
...How long was I in there?
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Not broad backed!
Lift!! And slide!
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
What-what is it?!
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Yeah.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Everyone, this is Julie.
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
That's my sister.
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Only way to fly.
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
What's her last name?
Yeah, okay.
Not yet.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Hi Tushie.
All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
And here's little Ben nodding off...
Bye Janine!
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
What are you talking about?
Good for a scrud.
Hi!
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Oh no!
It's just a fur ball.
Something about hi.
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Hey!
What do I do now?
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
I can't believe this is happening.
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Who's that?
Hey!
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
Halftime.
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Argh!
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
What?!
Ohh.
What is it?
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
Okay, wish me luck.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
That's right.
Unagi. I'm always aware.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
What's up?
What?
Getting it away from me would be job one.
No, just give me another minute.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Hey man.
We'll give you Janice.
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
That's not bad.
What?
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Goodnight.
Please tell me you're joking.
Rach, I got a message from you.
Hey, I might!
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.
From you? Yes, please!
You are way off, pal.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
You like it?
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Yeah, right.
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
Rach...
I swear!
If you wanna put a label on it.
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Really?
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
It's ridiculous!
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
When I got married you slept with my sister.
No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
The paper.
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Hi.
Rach?
Yes I would.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
What're you talkin' about?
Why?!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey!
I like that.
Sure.
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Hey.
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
Monica did it?
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Don't toy with me.
Yeah!!
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
I'm not going to do that.
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Hey.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
Hi.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
No, come on don't start. Ouch!
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
There was no song. There was no song!
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Why- why are you here, Carol?
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Oh my God!
Yeah?
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Hey, you guys.
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
What? What?
Woooo!!!
What guys? Oh, yeah.
What's up?
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Look, I'm sorry.
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Wow! Happy Monica's night!
It's still looks pretty far!
Can't wait.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
I'm gonna call after you!
Hi!
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Hi.
What is it?
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
Dude! How-how did you write this?
Hiiiiii.
You like it right?
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
Hello!
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. The Lightning Round!
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
What?
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Not at the concert.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
You guys.
What are you doing?
Yes.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Oh, right!
Carol's pregnant.
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Yeah!
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Hey.
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
Yes, very nice Rachel.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Hey!
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
You take care Jill.
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
And she just gave you this?
Hey.
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Did you say something?
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Nah.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
I know.
Noo.
So, what? That's it?
Hey!
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Goodnight.
2 hours, 27 minutes.
Monica? You're Mom.
Is it? Feels like two.
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Oh my God.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
I can't believe this!!
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
That's not true!
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Well that's the first time we've said that.
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
Why are you laughing?
Come on.
We're looking into it.
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
Oh.
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.
What?! No!
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
About what?
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
Yeah, can't help but.
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
An egg?
Hi, Pheebs!
I would never do that!
Hey.
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
You don't believe in evolution?
I can't believe he didn't come!
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
I can.
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
What the hell happened on that beach?!
That is an old, Chinese woman!
Yeah, of course, Donald.
You got a tattoo?
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
I'll take that dad.
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Who?
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
What's goin' on?
Why are they here?
No thank you for... Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Is everything okay?
Oh thanks!
No, this is pretty much it.
So, can you trust me?
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Hey!
Uh.... bean! Bean!
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
So let's decide on the spending limit...
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
What are you doing here, Santa?
When did I say that?
I just wanna check something.
Let me see! Show them!
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Then tell him quickly.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Hey, it's my list.
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Hi!
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Really?
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
What's going on?
That's... that's classic.
Hey Phoebe!
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
Right.
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
I'm the ring bearer.
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Phoebe!
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
What?
I didn't order lemonade.
All right, try pedaling.
It's not a library...
Oh God, no.
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Yeah!
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Hey guys.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Okay, let's go.
Aw, Mom...
Yeah.
Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Okay.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
So uh, where's Monica?
What's the score?
Yeah!
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
Atta boy.
Thanks you guys.
Umm, jealous!
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
That little naked guy would be me.
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Huh? Oh, I got this--this!
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
Really?!
There he is!!
I guess it could.
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Pass it! Pass it!
I know.
What?
I-I had to show Chandler something?
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Would it matter?
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
You mean hardball?
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
What, what oh....
Excellent!
Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
Mm-Hmm.
What's going on?
Y'know what...
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Yes, you can, very much.
Wow, hello! You look great!
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
No, I'm good.
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
Wait, wait, wait.
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
Ok.
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
What? Is it the comet?
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
So how'd it go?
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
Oh.
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Later!
Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Okay?
Do you have a point?
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
I don't know Rachel, why?
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
What?
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
That's a good point.
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
What? What?
What?!
OK, I need to lie down.
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
Well, he had gravity boots.
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Okay dad.
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
No.
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Okay, I...
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
Aww.
Really?
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
OK, now, sit. OK.
I'll make some calls.
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
No!
Yeah.
Rachel. Hey.
They don't look any bigger than me!
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
What?
What? Ow!
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
How is that important?
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
After what I did? Can you blame her?
I want my turkey now!
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
You are totally jealous.
Oh my God. Congratulations.
How 'bout Ben?
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Oh, hello.
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Are you sure?
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Hey!
I am a good kisser.
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
Maybe not.
Oh fine.
She may have died.
Bye.
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Noo!
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
Hey!
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
And, I love you!!
But-but, Liam's on my team.
Let's show 'em.
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Yeah.
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
What? Where?
So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Wow! I could've died tonight.
And on your anniversary, for shame!
Okay.
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
Oh, hi Chloe.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
All right.
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
Why?
No.
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
What?
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
Fine.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Yeah.
Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
Hi!
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Phoebe!
Marlon?!
No! No! No!
Yeah! Right!
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Dude, what am I gonna...
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
You're wrong.
What?
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Joey, please!
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Oh my God!
There y'go.
Yeah?
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
Ahh, no.
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
And thank you, for that.
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
All right.
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
That is correct.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Okay. Cool.
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Cheers!
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
That was you?
Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
Ahh, no, I'm good.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Ahhhh!!
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Oh. Oh-oh.
Um, just some presents.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Damnit!
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?
Wha, uhh, what?
Mmm.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
Joey?!
Hey, what's this?!
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Yeah, right!
Right.
Hello.
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
I see. So what do you propose to do?
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Hey!
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
I love you.
It was just a kiss.
Besides, there's a big age difference.
Yeah, what's going on?
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
Umm...
You still love me.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
No way!
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
Good evening officer.
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
No.
Mmm. Oh, no-
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
What's going on?
Mon?
What?!
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Yes but too me he's just, man.
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Okay.
Bye.
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
What's the matter? You okay?
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Can I see you for a second?
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Hi.
I could ask her to live with me!
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
I got itI'm getting it!
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Are you serious?
Where exactly is your zoo?
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
