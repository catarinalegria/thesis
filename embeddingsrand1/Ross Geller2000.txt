I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
Whaddya got there?
That's what I'm telling you.
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
C'mon, it's my birthday.
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
Damnit!
Really?
Hi!
I know.
Then you should have said something before I met her.
Okay. Hut! Hike!
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Mon?
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Noooo.
I will, I will find him.
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
No.
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Hey you guys.
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
How we doing, you guys ready?
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
What?
No-no-no-no-no.
Yeah, that'd be cool!
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
You're not going to go.
I'm starving!
Yeah.
Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch.
Ok, Mom never hit.
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
It took two people to break up this relationship!!
My hands?
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Baking it didn't help, huh?
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
You don't have to shout everything.
What? Great, now I'm having a baby.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
What?
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Bye Ben.
The volcano?
Hello!
You okay?
Did you see me write one down?
No.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
I'm not going to do that.
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
...How long was I in there?
I don't know. A month?
I like this song.
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So how'd it go?
Marcel?
Well thanks!
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Doorknob! Doorknob!
Hey!
Yeah.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
Is that Mark?
Thank you!
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Oh yeah, why not?
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Hi!
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
And his first name.
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Nope.
No!
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Sure. I'll help you.
What?
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Mon?
Oh my God. Congratulations.
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
China.
Alright.
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Right.
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
Here you go.
...since I stopped trying.
What happened?
Wha, what?
Whad'ya mean?
Is that what I want?
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
Hey!
We already knew that!
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Fine.
What happened?!!
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Yeah, okay.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Totally.
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
What?!
this summer?
Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Awwww!!!
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Now she's passed.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
You're welcome.
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Hey, thanks Rach.
Um, just some presents.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
I sort've already asked Chandler.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so...
That's okay, Joe.
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
What? That's like insanely easy!
Yeah.
Oh.
Mmm-Hmm.
Look, I do not re-love her.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
All right.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Okay!
You are way off, pal.
Bummer.
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
Hey!
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny...
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
I'm in.
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
What?
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
What, uh... what were you thinking?
Yep.
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
What? Are you going back to work?
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Monica!
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Hey!
I think that would be best.
Get married.
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
No!
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Yeah.
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
Hey!
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
How's my little boy?
What?
We'll be starting with apples.
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Whoa! You had sex today?
Cat.
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
No.
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
You still love me?
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
You still on that?
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
That is so unfair!
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Okay, that's, that's enough.
Hey, you're right.
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Good.
And what are you going to do for him?
Yep?
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
Hey, Pheebs!
Good for you.
All right.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Well, technically it seven billion years ago...
Right.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
I do.
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
What?! No!
Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
Oh I a lot of stuff!
You got it.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Yes, tell me.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Happy too.
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
So really, what'd ya have?
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
Okay, see ya later.
Okay, good-good for you.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Good for a scrud.
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Uh-huh.
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
They published my paper.
This is not fun!
I was not!
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
Uh, hello!
No! No we don't!
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Where the hell have you been?
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
So?
Emily?!
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
You think?
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
That audition.
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Okay, okay take a guess.
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
W-What was the one right before bananas?
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Show me where?
What?
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Go Joe!!!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
Ohh, what's wrong?!
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Hey!
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
Hi.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Hey!
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Oh-oh, absolutely!
Uh... to the bathroom.
Oh no! An asteroid!
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Knock-knock.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Dad!!
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
We need more cards.
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.
Marlon?!
Oh God!
I guess so.
No.
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
And you didn't marry him because...?
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
What? What?
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
No, but, your-your mad.
Hiiiiii.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Carol?
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
FINE BY ME!!
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Ohh! Thank you.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
What?
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
Hey!
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Good, so do I
You know what I like most about him, though?
I can.
Sorry.
But, okay.
Hey, what's this?!
I'm hurt.
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Pass it! Pass it!
You're wrong.
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Pretty soon I guess.
Yeah!
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Of course she would, you're a college man.
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
I think the check in is that way.
Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
Bye.
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Oh, aaaah!
No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
Ohh, it was the best!
Yeah.
I would say that.
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Are you serious?
Thanks. What photo album was it?
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
You-you had what?
Hey.
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
...Now that was fun.
Argue with that.
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Oh, now you want a favour?
You had fantasies about Emily?
It was just a kiss.
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
We're not alone.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
What the hell happened on that beach?!
Hey!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
How's it going?
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
Yeah? How much?
Hey, hey Rach!
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Hey!
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
200 dollars.
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Am I?!
Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
What?!
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Yeah.
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
Practical jokes.
Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Press the button.
I had a problem.
Hey guys!
No, it's a concept!
Hi.
Nothing I do means anything, really.
No, I've looked everywhere!
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Easy.
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
There's an image.
Yeah! Got it!
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
All right.
Oh! No-n-
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
What you got over there? Tacos?
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Yeah.
No, that's fine.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
No?
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Give me two.
You're not a lefty?
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
You're not laughing.
I know.
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Well, you can help me!
Help! Help!
She lent me an egg once.
Hi.
Hi!
Hey!
Oh, whatever.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
What?!
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
What?
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
And we didn't have sex.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
Argh!
Yeah. What do you think.
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
I mean my God...
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
There are naked ladies there too.
Are you guys sure about this?
I want to take my tongue... and...
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Oh my God, you guys!!
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh. Hel-lo!
I will give you a call.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Ohhh! Kids!
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
No. It's the one he's licking.
Okay.
...and I really think it should be me.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
No, no, let me finish.
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
What's up with the greed Joe?
Why?
What's going on?
Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Okay.
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Oh.
Hey, here's a thought.
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
You don't believe in evolution?
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
Thanks. You ready to go?
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Chandler! Chandler!
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
What?
What?!
Yeah, well.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
You are, you're welling up.
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
It didn't.
Nope, nope, that's it.
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
It's okay man, be strong.
Hi honey, how did it go?
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Well y'know 'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Phoebe!
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
That's right! Wait no, Ben.
Pepper?
Huh. This is nice.
He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Hey man.
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Department of Sanitation?
What?
You mean hardball?
It was, it was okay.
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
I can't believe this is happening.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Sure! Here.
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
What?!
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Yeah.
Let me see that! Oh man!
What?! Give-give me a brush.
Found it.
All right then.
Hey.
Hey!
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
Phoebe?
Hi.
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
You do Pheebs?
I swear!
Excuse me?
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Hello.
Er.... um.....
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Oh that is so great! That's...
A little bit.
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
See ya!
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
You're gonna be an aunt.
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Ohh.
Hey everyone!
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Why are we in bed together?
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Oh.. you don't get it!
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
Why did you do that?
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Oh man, this is hilarious.
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
Well... not in the same way...
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Hi!
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
Hey!
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
I-I had to show Chandler something?
The small one.
I don't know, umm...
Ahhh.
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
Excuse me?
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
...What shoe?
Come on, show them to me.
I can't believe he didn't come!
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
What?!
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
No, you stop!
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Hey!
Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
How'd did it go?
Wow! Yeah!
Joey's not going.
Yeah?
With mealworms.
Does she.
Hey! It's starting to snow.
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Excuse me?
What?
Ok, dinner's on.
What?!
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
Getting it away from me would be job one.
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
Hey!
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Howard?
Umm, jealous!
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Huh?
That's excellent.
Please tell me you're joking.
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Yeah.
Yeah, we went shopping!
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Hi.
Well, yeah!
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
I know, why not?
Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
Hey.
So we're a little late.
This is my wedding.
What are you talking about?
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
I do too! I do too!
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Why- why are you here, Carol?
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Hey, where'd you get that?
Is everything okay?
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
In London!
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
What?!
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
Which one is Gina?
Maybe it's a universal thing?
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Thank you.
Oh no.
Dude!
You're right!
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
Cool.
We have got to start locking that door!
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Oh, right!
Yeah!
Hi.
A-A day.
Come on, tell me.
Yeah.
Oh. Uhh...
You wanna explain that?
You have to respect the sea!
Hey!
What?
Five letters.
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
Oh.. oh... oh.
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Oh yeah.
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Does it always, uh--?
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Hi. Mom. Dad.
Do they wait for me to do this?
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
No.
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
And now you want that money back.
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Okay.
...Yeah.
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
Oh.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Bye Ryan.
So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Rach! Rach!
Why does anyone have to be naked?
In this life, Phoebe.
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Okay, sure.
No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Come on! Come on. Come on.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
It's too cold.
I know.
No.
Hey!
No, women are welcome to play.
Is uh, is Monica here?
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Aw, Mom...
Turn! Turn!
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Wow!
Yeah.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Huh.
Monica knows.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Man, I sure miss Julie.
Hi.
Hey Phoebe!
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Yeah.
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Come on, it's fun!
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Monica!
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...
Oh!
Hey everybody!
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
How sad are we?
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
.....Hi.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Yeah that's the same.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
This place is really beautiful!
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
What's-what's the difference?
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
Dude, you are sick.
That would be me.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Hey!
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Why?
Yeah.
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
I, er...
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...
You got a tattoo?
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Uh-huh.
The routine!
Come on! That's great.
'Scuse us
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Thanks. OK.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
Okay!
Total wuss!
You got ink on your lip.
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Okay. Cool.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Yeah, no problem.
Rach, have you never done this before?
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Yeah.
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
It's just I miss her so much.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
What do you mean?
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
I would never do that!
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
I don't want to do that.
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
It does. It really and truly does.
Dude, we were good!
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Bunny!
Bye.
Hey!
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Yeah.
Hi!
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
OH...MY...GOD!!
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Nono, she's gone.
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
What?
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Joey?!
Excuse me.
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
I'm not a nice guy.
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
What?
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Yeah.
So uh, Emily called last night...
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
That is what the thing is.
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
Okay.
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Okey-dokey!
Ugh, museum.
What a pity stay?
Hey, is Chandler here?
How's the hair?
Sorry.
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
No, why?
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
What's she look like?
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Just a smidge.
Get out!
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Are you into crafts at all?
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
Breathe.
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Hey! Are you ready yet?
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
I'll take that dad.
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Good-good-good.
No!
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Ooohhhh!!
Okay.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Alright, shall we?
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
But, you are.
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Okay.
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
Huh?
Are you OK?
Hey
Ohh, okay.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Gunther?!
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Shut up.
Need some help?
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
What are you talking about?
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Alright.
Oh, well...
Hiii.
Thanks Rach.
You all right?
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
I don't know if it's true.
Oh no!
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Bye sweetie.
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
Let's show 'em.
The physical act of love.
I am your friend.
Got me.
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
I have a bone to pick with you.
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Yeah!
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
There it is.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Hello.
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Four.
Not at the concert.
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
No.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Oh, it was, nah, well....
A what?
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
So what's it shaped like?
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Awww, man! Really?
How'd the callback go?
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
What happened? Joey?
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
You're wrong.
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Okay, good bye!
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
Sure.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
What's going on?
Yeah! Right!
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Must pee.
So-so come! Why don't you come?
Hi ma.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
What-why?
Why?
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey!
Hey!
She may have died.
Was your basket on top?
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Pheebs!
In the death seat?!!
Come on, seriously.
That was different!
Uh-huh.
Okay sorry, whew.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Oh.
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Then be supportive like a guy.
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
Rach!
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Well umm...
And bus.
I know.
Well...In-in case of emergency.
What?
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
The test is ready.
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Hey!
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Is this about Mark?
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Yeah!
You, you go long.
Yeah.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
I'll get it! I will get that!
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
Let me see! Show them!
All right.
Woah.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
Hey, how are you holding up?
Thanks.
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Hi!
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
How is that important?
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Rachel! What are you doing here?
What's the part, Anti-man?
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Thanks.
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Yeah!
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Hi.
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
We can't do it again.
Something about hi.
What are you doing?
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Hey!
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Phoebe!
Hey!
Yeah, make that three.
You have a line down your face.
You grow up.
Okay! Hey!
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Yeah!
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Hey guys.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Yes, yes, that's right...
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Thank you.
Okay.
Man! They cannot get enough!
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
You hated me when we were kids?
Um, yeah.
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Hey!
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
I don't know you guys.
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
When?
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
So, can you trust me?
So, what's going on now?
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
This is beautiful!
Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
C'mon.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Huh?
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Spring vacation.
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Hey!
I don't know what to say.
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
Bye.
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Oh, you're...
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Yeah!
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Wha... what, here?
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
What?
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
It's your joke.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Ohio!! Thank you!
Hi!
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Ohhh.
Yay!
Okay! Hey Tommy.
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
Okay, let's go.
What happened you guys?
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Okay.
Phoebe.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Stupid balls are in the way.
Meth-methane smells...
Hey listen man, about the stripper...
And what is second prize?
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
E-except, except that what?
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
He gave me a pill for it.
What's going on?
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
Hey, there.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Good call!
Looks like a fun gang.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Yeah.
Hi! It's me.
Look, I'm sorry.
Good luck!
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Really?
Fine.
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Monica! Would it?
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
What's goin' on?
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Am I?!
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
That said it was my sandwich?!
No.
Where's Ben?
What?
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
You like it?
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
I'm gonna be on TV!!
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
You're over me?
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
You will?!
Thanks.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Oh no-no-no!
Yeah, okay.
Par-tay!
Oh, wake up!
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
You know the song! Sing along!
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
Umm?
OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Hey, you wet my pants!
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
Yeah, take your time.
Die Hard!!!!!!
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Oh, hi Chloe.
And it works both ways.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Can I see you for a second?
Look I told you...
Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Oh, who cares?
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
Oh, thank God!
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Honey, I love you too.
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Ahhhh!!
Hey! What's up?
Happy birthday!!!
Oh.
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Eh?
Yes, you can, very much.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! .
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
Hey.
It's a rug.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Hey!
You're bleeding.
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
You've sentenced him?!
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
Stopped for a Chunky.
Yes! My baby's finally free!
Okay.
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
And so do I.
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
What?
Nah.
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Yeah.
You did it, man.
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Bye!
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
All right. Okay, here we go!
Yes!
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Pheebs, what are you doing?
That's closer.
Aqui est.
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Oh-oh, yeah.
Oh! Yeah.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
It's your turn.
Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
They're not listening too me?
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Really?
What, that wasn't the great news?
Yeah?
Hey!
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Why? What?
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
How did he do this?
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
You look pretty tonight.
Oo-oo!
Ohh, this cake is really good!
Huh.
Ah, Cheryl!
What?!!!
You still love me.
Okay?
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Hey, what you do on your own time...
Hey, Pheebs.
You mean, we-you and me?
Hi!
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Hey.
Thank you.
Why are you mad at me?
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Nobody likes change.
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
I am a good kisser.
Get the what?
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Got it!
Is everything okay?
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Got me.
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
She's not even here yet.
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
You need to get some sleep.
Yay!
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
So that's two of my wives.
What?! Over a stupid room!
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
What?!
Hey!
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Hey.
No, 10 is the highest.
I am now.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Why am I not surprised?
Yeah, well...nah.
Oooooh.
Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
No problem.
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Chloe? Hi..
Thank you.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
No!
Monica. Whaddya think?
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Excellent, that was excellent.
It's an empty apartment.
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
Alright, I want my monkey.
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
I know. My arm is killing me.
Hey guys!
Also an island.
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Hey!
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Hey!
And that wasn't fun for you?
I love you.
She was...
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Not broad backed!
A little.
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
So, for the whole weekend?
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
Burt!
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
I could ask her to live with me!
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
What the? What...
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
So you do know a little English.
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Hi Whitney.
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
Tho?
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
What's goin' on?
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Okay.
Thanks!
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Why did you hate me?
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Chandler!
Please don't say naked chicks.
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
Yeah?
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Hey roomies!
What?
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
Umm, no. No.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
Ah, which, which one?
No one got me an engagement present.
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Not on you! On the stripper!
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Yeah!
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Why? Why can't you go to him?
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Hey!
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Hey!
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
What the hell are doing?!!
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
That's right!
But you already told me everything.
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
Or that.
Hey, guys!
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Right?
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
She said what?
Yeah, maybe.
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
What?
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Nevermind!
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
What?
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
Hi, honey.
JOEY!!!!!!
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Hi!
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
I'm going to China.
Shoot.
That's right!
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
What?
Actually, no, we're not.
No. I am not putting on makeup.
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
To wear in front of people?
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
What?
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
Thanks for being born.
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Ooooohhhh.
No.
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
What, it's not your fault.
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Can't we just use a pen?
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Marcel! What've you done to him?
Mm.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Oh yeah, why not?
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
Really.
Okay.
No, 19.
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Hi!
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
Hi.
Sorry.
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
Dude!
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
Oh-oh really?
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Hey, what's goin' on?
Aww, is it broken?
I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
So, uh, he's back.
That little naked guy would be me.
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
It's my joke.
Rachel. Hey.
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
The screaming guy?
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Let's give it a shot.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Move in with me.
All right!
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
Yeah.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Ohh! That would be great.
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Tell me about it.
Hey.
I was saving you.
OK, I need to lie down.
Oh my God! Monica!
No, I can't get it out.
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Gimme the this!
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
Thank you guys-guys-guys...
Mon, look who I ran into!
Uh.
And, I love you!!
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
G'night.
Yeah.
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Yeah!
Turn.
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
I've been back and forth.
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Hey Chandler. Monica!
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
What? Is it the comet?
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
Okay, it's not, it's not.
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
So uh, have a great time down there.
Sorry.
Yes, I do.
You ate my sandwich?
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Catch any big fish?
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
No, you let me fini...
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Yeah, I think she looks good.
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Yeah, it really was!
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
No.
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Me too!
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Over my dead body!
What're you talkin' about?
Look, can, can you do something for me?
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Come on.
What happened?
What, what oh....
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Thanks.
I am dressed.
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Yeah, okay, Scott!
What?
Everything? Even the TV?
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
What? What? What? What is it?
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
Hey guys.
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
How might you be wrong?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
What's going on?
Yes it is. See.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Oh...
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
Yeah.
What-what do you mean?
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
It's not a library...
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Yeah.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Oh yeah, I'd love that.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
It was my first time.
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
Hey!
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Look, I'm sorry.
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
Where exactly is your zoo?
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
I'll take it. My gift to you man.
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
