Yeah! Okay, here you go.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Ow!!!
Oh, I'll get it.
Great! Thank you very much.
Shut it down.
What?!!
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
Oh.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Why is Ross doing that?
Demi Moore.
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Oh!!
