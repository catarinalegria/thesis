Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
Let's take it from there.
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
All right.
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
C'mon in.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
No, I ahh, had another idea.
Uh, no not really. Why?
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
I think we have an answer.
Oh-no-no-no-no....
You were right.
Oh. They don't.
A sandwich?
I can't imagine why.
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Excuse me?
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
You by the door. In or out?
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
Absolutely!
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Really? About what?
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
No, please.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
You are!
Phoebe, listen...
Bye.
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
I thought it was toner.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
I beg your pardon?
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Yeah.
I know what your problem is.
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
Well thanks.
Hey!
Who is it?
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Uh, sure, why not.
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Hey!
And wait, I've got something for you.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Bye dad.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
When's your birthday?
I will flip you for it.
That I was not expecting.
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
Take care.
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Hello.
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
No.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Lose the robe.
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
What?! Why?
Sorry!
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Whoa!
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
Hey! Rachel!
Uh-huh.
So you guys want me to take this back?

Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Come on.
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
