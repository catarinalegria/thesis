That could be it.
I don't think so dear.
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
That's sweet. Could I take her?
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
I'm pregnant.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Hey guys.
What?
Nooo!
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Hi, Ross.
I am not telling you guys anything.
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Morning.
Eight whole days.
Hey.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
Huh?
You are so sweet.
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.

Hi.
I'm Amanda.
That's fine, thank you.
What's with this guy?
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
Hi.
Your messages have been erased.
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Why?!
Are you serious?
Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
You never know.
I could have birds.
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
Okay lady, you're out of here.
No! I mean he's nice.
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
What?!
I'm here!
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
Okay, yeah!
Plate?
You're look for laughable...
Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
Yeah.
He painted that.
You ready to go?
I got an extra one. You want this?
No.
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
Oh!
You by the door. In or out?
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
You are now.
Mm-hmmm
Okay, I'll do it.
Am I too late?!
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Yeah, it was.
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I'll see you later?
We have great news!
No, but I can't-
I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
Great!
Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
Who in the hell are you?
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Okay.
That's my monkey.
No that's my assistant.
Ohh, it's time to go.
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Hey!
You don't secretly smoke do you?
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Well, you certainly own that room.
Me too.
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Oh! You know what I need?
Yay!
A lesbian?
That'd be great, thanks.
I came to give you this and this.
Well I just thought...
Monica! Hi honey.
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Hi!
Hello Skidmark.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
This couch belongs to us.
It's not that kind of anniversary.
Flexible hours.
Hi. Hi.
What do you mean?
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
We appear to have angered it.
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Hey.
As were you.
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
Don't be too long.
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
So, what's up?
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Ready, Annabelle?
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
That's a good one!
Hey!!
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
Um-hum, you're jealous.
What?
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Who are you?
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
What?!
Oh!
Oh my God!
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
Yes.
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
Uh--
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
What?

The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
You OK?
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
All right. I'll get my bag.
Oh no.
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Phoebs.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
So, what did Francis leave me?
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
Bye-bye.
Yeah.
Uh, the usher told us to come...
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
I am!
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Why?
Hi.
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
So uh, who's your photographer?

Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
