Fine!
No-no!! No!!
Hi!
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
God, what a mess.
Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
There's sooo much you don't know.
Oh, I couldn't go in.
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Frank! Hi!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Oh, yay!
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Me?!
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Oh, okay then.
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Maybe, because you told him not to.
Oh, I see.
They have the best stuff in there.
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
Your nails.
Rachel has a new doll.
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Nu-uh!
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Rifts. Yeah, I know.
Yeah!
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
Fine! Be murky!
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Bye you.
What?!
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
You know who shaved you? That was me.
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
Oh, en chante.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Ugh, I hate this year!
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
I think maybe, yeah.
Ah!
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Oh yeah.
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Hey!
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Hi.
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
Marcel?
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Oh my God!
Are... are you OK?
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Yeah Im fine.
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
What's going on?
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Yes.
Yeah, yeah!
Oh! You got it?!
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Oh no! Why?
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
You know he's gay?
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Okay.
Ohh!
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Oh yeah.
I don't have it!
Yeah!
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
You're kinda stepping on the song.
I saw it.
So, here we are. Nervous?
Oh!
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
Okay. I'm going with you.
Oh man.
Sure.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
Oh, I get a puppy!!
So did you sleep well last night?
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Ooh! Oh!
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
How close?
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
Apology accepted.
What are you saying I should do?
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Oh, hello liar.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
17 years ago.
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
You completely stole my answer!
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Ameri-can.
Nothing-Why?!
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Lilly's dead.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Well...
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
So...Thank you.
No, no, it's just my tooth.
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Okay.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Hey!
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
You're there!
Go ahead.
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Alright, whadyou do with him?
What do you mean?
Ohh!
So nothing got ruined?
Huuh.
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Okay sure!
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Yeah?
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
Sur-surprise.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Okay.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Yeah?
Oh!
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Yeah she said something about crumbies.
All right. Good luck.
But I already gave them back to you!
Yes, but I'm doing this.
A dollar?
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
You're Frank's best man?!
Hey!
You mean like a doctor?
YOU KNOW?!!!
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Hey, Lizzie.
Well, if you think it will help.
Nope, not knocked up yet.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
But she just came up here!
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
and...
What is your job?
Sure.
Hey.
Oh.
Ohhh!!!
Hi Emily!
Ten dollars an hour for what?
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Whatcha doin'?
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
Wow, it was so-wow!
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
Okay. Oh, no!
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Oh Chandler!
I thought you meant in life.
No.
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
You didn't get the money, did you?
Oh? Hello you.
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Allison's birthday party.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Okay.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Please.
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
Yeah, you never heard of them?
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
You can't give up on your dream.
Great! Okay, good for you!
...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
Well, we both have.
That'll work too.
That sounds great!
We ruined everything.
Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
Thank you.
Oh, okay.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
She wasn't a hooker.
It's nice that he has someone.
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Fauna.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
What?!
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Lusts of the flesh.
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
I'm not asking!
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
What?
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Nice try.
That's weird.
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Oh we do, but not just yet.
OOooooo!
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
You guys are here! Yay!
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
And this?
Excuse me.
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
Does Joey know?
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Don't even get me started on yours!
Then yes that is what I'm having.
Love....
Yeah, all right.
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Jason is not a sissy!
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
You didn't read this one either?!
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Sure! Where is it?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
So that story doesn't make you cry?
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
Oh hey!
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Yeah.
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Does it look like a urinal?
Yeah, totally!
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Which time?
Hey!
Well, maybe 25-26.
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Okay.
That is funny.
Yeah?
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Yeah, what town are we near?
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Oh, which museum?
Chandler what are you doing?!
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Ha. Ha, ha.
Oh?!
Open bar!
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
What? You mean behind my back?
Yes, good! Ok...
No! I do want to!
I'm having another heart attack!
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
Such a pig!
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
I love this game!!
But...
Thanks.
Hey!
Yeah, it's beautiful.
I sang. Hah!
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Oh, well, actually.
There's no dog in here.
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Yeah well, we'll see.
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
What?!
Hey, what's going on?
Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
That's great Joe!
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
She is so great! I miss her.
Hey!
Hey!
Really? I've heard better.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
What does she mean by HH?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
What?
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
I stepped in something icky.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Great.
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
Oh, no.
Really?! Really?!
Rachel.
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
I miss you too!!!!
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Ross?!
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Yeah!
Ewww!
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
Uh uh.
Okay.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Hi.
I don't what your talking about.
Uh-huh.
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Totally.
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Hey!
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
See, he's her lobster.
Ohhh, wow.
No listen to me! She is crazy!
None the less.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Rachel.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
You guys!
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Noooo!!
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
Nothing! This is not over!
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Hey!
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Okay.
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Hi.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Well, he didn't tell me.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
What are they?
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
Okay. See?
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Maybe your scene's coming up?
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Really?!
Yeah absolutely!
On a totally different bet.
Whoa! I kinda liked it.
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Hey!
Oh Willie's still alive!
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Yeah.
I know, I took it hard too.
Hey!
I'm in.
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
No.
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Huh.
What? What?
Um, do you wanna sit?
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Hmm, how about my azzz?
Why not?
Was it not pain-free?
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
You're all invited to bite me!
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Yes! Very good.
Yeah, it was really hard.
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Oh, Chandler funny?
Pat Sajak?
Duly noted.
What?
YOU KNOW?!!!
Rach?
Hey cool, mine too.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
What?
But I like it here!
That and arrogance.
About what?
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
Umm, yeah! Today's.
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Plate! Yes, plate.
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Ohh. . .K. How come?
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
Okay, London 1...
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Oh hi!
So.
Why not?
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
Yeah?
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Hey.
Oh.
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
See, I didn't know that.
And call me!
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!

You ate meat! You had sex!
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
Sing!!
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Yes!
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Thanks! So are you.
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Hey, and then lunch.
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Because she's your lobster.
Wow!
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Hi!
So-so you're really not going?
Hi.
Uh-huh.
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
I guess so.
Hummus. I got the hummus.
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Uh-huh.
God!
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Well you don't.
Wh-wh-what are you doing?
Here he is.
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
What?!
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
Yeah, he's gotta go.
We could not, would not want to wait.
I've had better.
What about this?
I don't know! I don't remember!
Me too!
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Waxine!!
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
Yeah.
Come on! Look where you are!!
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
Oh.
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
What's going on?
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
John?
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Why?
Okay bye.
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Yes, please.
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
How'd he take it?
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
We're all right.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
I'm having a really good time!
Woo-yay!!
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Why not?
Okay.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
The end.
Okay then.
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Shh! Get me out of here.
Drum roll.
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
Uh-huh, what?
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
Uh... yay!
OK, let's go.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
You missed a belt loop.
Half full of looooovvvvve.
Yeah?
Finger sandwiches and tea.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Just kidding!
Hey!
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
Well, he's very charming.
Yeah, come to papa.
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
I'm pretty.
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
So is it like art?
Right, and its me.
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Hey!
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
The movie?
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Okay.
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Oh Ross, hi.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Let's see!
Hi.
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
I'm sorry, who's this?
Wait, you can't take the money out.
Demi Moore.
Hi Joey.
Hey.
Which proves that I never lie.
You tired Chandler?
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
I know.
What umm, what happened?
And who else is going to be there?
Bye, good luck.
I'm sorry.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
My little brother's getting married!!
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Please, I think you know why.
There you go.
We're practically kissing.
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Ooh, uh...
Yeah.
Yeah, swing music is so out.
Oh no.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Yeah?
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
Could you speak up please?
Oh, let me see!
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Stick a fork what?
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
Hey!
Good. So what were you thinking?
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Sorry. How about over here?
Isn't he great?
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
That's a defense?
Okay then.
What?! What the hell?!
Oh my God!
Nu-uh!
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
Hi, so what happened?
You know?!
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
You think you know me so well.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Oh my God! Is that him?
Excuse me, is this your car?
Hey!
Hey!
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
No I didn't!
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Going to the hospital tonight?
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Oh good.
Oh.
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
Mmmm hmmm.
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
I think she's OK.
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Hi, so what happened?
Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Seriously, what-what's the part?
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
Do it!
Fired! Why?
Oh my God!
Ugh, PBS!
Wow. Thank you.
Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?

Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
Intense and creepy.
You didn't tell her did you?
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Then don't touch one!!
Getting so good at that!
Uh-hmm.
Oh, my.
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
But you guys came so close.
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!

Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
Hey.
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
Hey Rach.
Why not?!
You'd already broken up.
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Hey.
Oh.
They are. Why?
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Ohh-oh, chilling!
Okay.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
She's dead.
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
See, we don't need them.
Oh sure! Noo!
Oh, Rachel.
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Chandler?
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
You wanna work on your interview skills?
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Ooh.
Kills you?
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Wherere you going?
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
And a glass of tepid water.
Yeah, me, too, technically.
You said it was okay!
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Hey!
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
He could be in disguise, y'know.
I can't believe this!
Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
You know her?!
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
Hey!
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
I can do that for the kids.
Hee hee!
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Wait here. Breathe.
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
Hey!
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Okay!
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Gunther, kiss me.
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Open it up, let me see.
No, you have to let me in right now!!
Yum-my!
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Ross, thank God.
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
Yeah?
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
No, you?
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Ooh!
No! Why?
Yeah.
Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
Hey.
I'll be waiting.
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Surprise! Look who's back!
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
Rdtor.
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
What?
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
All right, the seven of us miss you.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
No!
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
Garfunkle.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Oh!
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Okay, I have a wedgie.
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Ok, do you know A minor?
You said I was boring--Ohh!
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
Nice!
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
Everything you've heard is true.
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Monica, leave him alone!
Yeah?
So?
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
Yeah.
Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Don't interrupt me!!
Oh, oh! It's on again!
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Ick, you were eavesdropping.
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
All right all ready.
So what's going on with you?
Ready?
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Well, are any of those people here?!
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
Pastrami.
It's not that bad.
Oh, I have cards!
What?
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
They're here already? How are they doing this?
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
Would you care to venture one?
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Yeah?
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
This is Monica.
Bye.
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
No, but you're questioning my method!
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Are you alright?
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Why?
Your middle name is Pamela?
Can I tell you a little secret?
Hey! Look who I found!
Oh! Ooh! Umm!
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
Okay, your highness.
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Sure.
Floopy?
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Well, actually it's just from me.
Thank you.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
Ohh!
Oh, poor baby.
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
What did he say?
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
What?
You sound like a guy.
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
You're right.
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Ok, I'll walk you out.
It's your thing, and-
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
Yeah, this has happened before.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
It's James Bond.
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
What are we going to do?!
You just said...
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
What are you saying?!
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Ok so will he be back soon?
You guys!! Come on!
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
All right, that's it, I quit.
Knock, knock, knock.
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Ohh.
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
Oh well y'know.
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Yeah.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
You cook naked?
I know!
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
What kind of an emergency?
Yeah.
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Yeah.
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
Why? Why would you do that?
Okay, who's next?
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Ohh, get a room.
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Oh.
Okay that's so generous!
Ewwww!!
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
No, why?
Hey, Mon.
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Oh, thanks!
All right, what's going on there?
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
So, you're like a zillionaire?
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Nooo!!
It isn't?
You're Frank Buffay?
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Who said you were?
Hey!
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
That won't go with this dress though.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Ok. One.
No!
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Ooh, it's not bad.
I guess.
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Hm-mmm.
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
Okay, scarf's done.
Who's Barney.
Yeah? Hi!
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Hey!
I don't think you mean that.
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
Yes!
They were threefold.
Oh! No problem! I...
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Petrie.
Yeah! Okay.
What are you talking about?
Why would you kill his fish?
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Oh.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Oh, I'd like that.
Ooh, I like cards.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
What?!
What?! Why?!
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
All right, and umm...
Good! Good! Five points!
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
What?
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
I am shocked! Shocked!!
I'd call that excessive.
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
Yeah!
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Oh don't do that.
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Why?
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
Okay, listen Robert...
Hey.
Thank you. We both forgive you.
Good one! Yeah.
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
So was it a lot more money?
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Okay.
Hey!
Stay.
Hey!
I know.
Hi!
Hey there, you handsome thing.
The next, next?
Joey!
Nooo! Why would you think that?
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
Marcia and Chester.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Yes! Your honor?
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
Hellooo!
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Oh, me too!
Yeah.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
Hi! Wish me luck!
Good! Great! You can go first.
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
Oh.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
God Joey, this is taking forever!
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Oh, there they are!
Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
What?!
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Give it!
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Really?
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Oh thank you.
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
Oh. Oh.
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Sure!
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Bye.
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
So good!
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Well, so do a lot of people.
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Or, or the rodeo!!
So? Did you get the annulment?
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
God, Susan is so fun!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
How do you feel?
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
We have good news, look whose back!
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
The woman who cuts my hair!
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
I'm just helping the kids!
All right, get a room.
Wooo!! Hoo!!
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Ooh, now you lost me.
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
So what are they doing?
Okay. Well there's one down.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
Oh, that's great!!
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Can you hear anything?
and...
Well, he made a move on me.
Hey!
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Oh, ew!
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Oh.
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Which one?
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
What? Oh my God!
Ow! Ow!
I wa-I wa-I wa...
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
I don't know, you might be the first one.
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
Hey!
Oh, the Olympics.
Yeah.
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Why are you being weird?
No!
Ohh, you're a freak!!
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
I-I sure will, take care.
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
About how good your cards were.
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
A chin dimple!
Ohhh!!!
Okay.
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Oh, hi.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Wow, cute one!
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
I, but you're so close! No!
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Oh.
My Saturn dealership.
Hey!
Ugh!
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
I have quarters!
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
Yeah!
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Oh, hi Ross!
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
That oughta do it.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Heh?
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
Hey.
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
You have a third nipple?
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
What?
Do you want a refill?
Okay.
No, I'm fine.
Yeah.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
What?
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
No, I can spot you from here.
What?! No! It was my idea!
Okay, there.
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Hello!
Do it do it do it!
Great! Thank you very much.
Thanks you guys! Again.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
And a small piece of chocolate.
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
You two will have very hairy children.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
What happened?
500 bucks at a flea market?!
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Oh, you're not a dingus.
Everything?
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Sure!
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Hello?
No, I want this to happen.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
North route or south route?
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
You do?
Uh-hmm.
What are you talking about?!
And this is Rachel.
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Ehh!!
And chili!
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Hi.
Hey, you're early.
Huh?
My God, Joey!
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
Joey.
No that made me feel precious.
Oh, fine! Take his side!
I got me some drinks!
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Okay. Bye!
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
What?!
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
What's goin' on?
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
Oh.
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Which Richard?
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Oh, sly.
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
I know.
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Oh. Uh, I'm on.
Susan, he looks just like you.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Definitely not his mother.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
I love Jacques Cousteau!
Interesting.
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Hi!
Ohh, ohh.
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Yeah, I've been around.
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
He shot a bird!
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Ok, you weren't there.
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
I know.
Really?!
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Eww!
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
No Rachel! They got here first!
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
I see what you're doing!
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
Bye!
Naked alone time.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Please...wait, how did you do that?
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
Oh! Oh! Oh!
No! Barry and Mindy.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
Did you find it?
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh, I...
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Nope.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Hey.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Oh that's not so bad.
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
Do I?
You really thought it was perfect?
So, what movie should we see?
Yeah.
What makes it pilgrim?
Oh, so, how are we doing?
What do you know?!
Is it a meatball sub?
The name was my favourite part!
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
Nah. I kept myself busy.
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Ok, have a good break-up.
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
OK.
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
I can do that.
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Why?!
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
I'll have coffee.
All right, you go.
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Doing it on this table.
Yeah, why not?
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Not yet, no.
No, just a barrel.
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
It's gone.
I know. They were mine.
Hey.
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
No.
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
Ross?
Huh?
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Monica!
Hey Ryan, what's up?
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
It could be like a big giant guy.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
What's going on?
I guess it was kinda funny.
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
No, I do not hear that.
Okay, but.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
Yes! .... or no.
What?!
You are just nonstop!
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Don't get me started on that.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Where's Chandler?
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Okay.
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Oh, how'd that happen?
What about my cab?
Hey!
We were out of Doritos.
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Well, he stabbed me first!!
Chandler, Chandler.
Uh-huh.
You told them he was missing?
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
No!
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
Are you crazy?
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Got it.
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Both of you together?
You were supposed to tell her!
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Bye!
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
I haven't really had any yet.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
We did have fun, didn't we?
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
You make up songs?
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
Jason?
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
I brought you alphabet soup.
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
So. You two are totally into each other.
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Oh, right!
Oops!
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Yeah.
So how are things going with you?
I would love that job!
Give it.
Joey.
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
How much was it?
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...
Hey!
Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
Aww, good. What?
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
If!
Hi.
I think it went into me.
Yeah?
Yeah, I don't need it.
Which you just gave up really quickly.
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
I know.
You have your birth certificate?
Of course!
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
Hi!
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Wow, look at these prices.
What is this? What's going on?
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
So how are things going with Paul?
Okay.
Hey.
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
I might have.
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
Hey, what's going on?
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Oh, like that's a word.
You guuuyys.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Oh no, how?
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Hey!
Well then definately don't take his name.
Well... It's a date.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
That's what I'm saying.
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Really?
Ta-da.
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Oh good!
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
I don't ever want to see you again!
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
Shiny.
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Hey.
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Okay?
Yeah, that'd be ok.
What the hell are you doing?!
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Ooh, absolutely!
Yay!
Well at least we know she's a woman.
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Ok.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
To Ross.
Okay.
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Hey!
Okay.
Oh my God, you look so good!
Oh no no.
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
No, I think you should tell them.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Yeah that's better than my way.
What, what are they talking about?
Oh. Hey!
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
Oh my God.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Oh, just ask him!
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
That's a good idea for a business!
I could do that.
Come on, take 'em off!!
Never mind, I got it.
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
Oh.
That's too much. Sorry.
What?!
All right, so, okay...
Thanks!
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Yeah!
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Well, I taught me and I love me.
It starts?
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
Aww, Pheebs.
Um, not even a little bit.
Your own boat?
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
Thank you.
Big Bird's friend.
So?
What's block?
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
Why, what happened?
Yeah?
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
Maybe on some level.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Here.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Fun Bobby is so great.
Oh, that's fine, no.
Sex in his chair.
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
You wanna try it again?
Oh my God!
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
...Flame Boy.
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Okay.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
Well, I am.
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Rachel? Um, hi.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
It is your office.
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
Ooh, who's it for?
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
Oh, yay!
Where are you going?
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Thinkin' about it.
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Shut up!
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
Hey!
Nothing. Nothing.
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Okay, bye!
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
What?!
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
No.
What?!
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
I just feel so, uhh.....
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Yeah!
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Ooohh, why?
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
My roommate.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Hey, how'd it go?
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Since when are you into swing music?
Okay, Widow!
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Hmm?
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Ross?
Bye, Gene.
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Hey!
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Yep!
Ugh, okay Sherlock!
A birthday party.
I know. This is really, really huge.
What?
Yeah! Okay, here you go.
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Hey!
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
What surprise party?
Okay, woo! Hi.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Yeah, I actually don't know...
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Yeah?
Is he alright?
Oh, yeah. What's this?
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Him? Him, Ross?
Okay, um, stay.
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
Cigarettes?!!
Uma Thurman.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Stilts?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
So how long have you known?
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
And why not?!
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
This is everybody. This is Ross.
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
That might work!
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
Remembered what?
Any luck?
Uh-huh!
Thank you! I know, though.
Thanks!
What were you doing?
You're actually going through with this?
Ooh, erotiery!
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Sorry.
But why does it even matter?!
Yeah?
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
Huh?
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Well, I hate to eat and run, but...
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
Like what?
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
Umm, Gene.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Hi.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Oh he's like a...
So... and?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Okay everyone, think thick.
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
I, umm, shut up!
How did you do that?
No, but let's come back to that later!
Fish!
No kind. He just makes it up.
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
Let's run towards them!
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
OK.
Two.
Just kidding. Ahh!
I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
Thanks.
Hey! What are you doing here?
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Oh my god! Where are you?
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
Oh, really.
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Oh, I can still do that.
So, um, have you told your parents?
Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
Alright. So um, stilts huh?
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
What?!
Oh my God!
Well that's great! Congratulations!!
I did, but that was really fun.
Yeah me too.
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
What I said you had...
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Hi!
Just for a second.
Whe-where did he put it?!
Oh.
Do you have my birth certificate?
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Bye, fat ass.
Okay. No. But thanks.
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Absolutely!
Hey!
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Oh, I'll get it.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
I had one.
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
Hey!
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
I can't believe you caved.
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Yeah, no, it was great.
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
Y'know what that means?
Uh-hmm.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Oh my God.
It's Phoebe.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Oh-my-God!
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
What?
Yeah. So?
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Yeah!
Both!
Whattaya mean?
Hey!
I am extremely talented!
Umm, cups.
It's Ross.
Hi!
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Umm, where's my purse?
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Hey.
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
What?
You're pregnant!
Oh!
Chandler!!
What?
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
You did the right thing.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
What do you mean?
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
What am I sitting on?
Okay.
Oh I know.
Hi.
Hi, Max!
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
What's the matter?
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
So, I'm here, ready to play.
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Hey!
I'm still on "no."
Ok, thanks.
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
We thought you knew!
That was my dad!
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
I don't have time for this.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
I'm having my first contraction!
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
What?!
That doesn't lock does it?
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Bye!!!
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Oh, this guy again.
Na-uh, I am!
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
Okay, you wore me down.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Well, it felt French.
Come on, like you never talk that.
Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
These old things.
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Man alive!
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Are you gonna go over there?
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Ew-eww!! Undies!
We're all right.
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
OK, that's my tattoo.
Hey.
Thanks.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Gum!
No, Joey.
I know.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
Hey!
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Oh my God Monica!
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
Okey-doke.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
Oh, they love your casserole.
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
All right, Joey, same question.
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Hey!
What?
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
I-We gotta get Monica.
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Oh yeah, come here.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Rachel?
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Which one do you have?
I think on my shoulder.
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Yeah. Sorry.
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
All right, I can't wait!
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
Better. Yeah.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
How'd you know I was coming?
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
Joey's!
Then change it back!
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
No!
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
Oh, it's not!
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Have you really done this before?
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
John Glenn is here?!
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Go! Go! Go!
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Okay whatever.
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Watching ballroom dancing?
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Hey, did she buy it?
You've never asked a guy out?!!
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Right.
I'm sorry.
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
I want to keep one.
Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
Hey.
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Hey!
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
What?!
Oh. Aw, forget it.
He's even kind of cute.
But we've only had one job.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Rach, you're in my seat.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Uh-huh!
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
Well, it's better than us deciding.
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Jack!! Hey!
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Okay. Hey Rach?
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Oh, yeah!
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Now, have you told anyone else?
Really?!
Are you still mad at us?
Paul.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
No.
Okay, quit down.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
No.
No, don't look directly at them!
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
So?
Okay.
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Why?!
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Our apartment is ready.
Oh I just miss him so much!
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Oh good!
No, we never do that
Oh, hi.
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Yay, I rock.
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
What?!
OK, well then what is this?
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Hi!
Really?
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Are you the cutest?
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Ooh! That's so nice...
Well, can you dance at all?
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
What?
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Hey!
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
You never run on a barge!
Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
Oh, look at that.
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Huh.
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Does that mean Carcass is available?
So, do you have any other possibilities?
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
There he is!
Okay.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
And we did.
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Is that a problem?
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
There he is! There he is!
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
I love the license plate game!
No, but he's always late.
Ahhh!!
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
God, what happened?!
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
Thanks! Okay.
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Yeah, what's your point?
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
I know.
What?
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Fine.
Wow!
No. Why?
Well hey, it's just a backup.
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
I found it!
Hi!
Aw, dammit!
Your mom was arrested?
I think it's important that you do.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
You're welcome.
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
Swear?!
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
You guys. You suck too.
Yeah!
Me too. Rachel.
This is Patrick.
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Yeah?
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Monica, in or out?
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
That play?
Wow.
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Enh. Sure!
You are just like Jack.
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Yeah?
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
I don't use a curling iron.
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
That game should not be played without my supervision.
Huh?
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Hey!
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Ohhh!
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Ross, please! My make-up!
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
No.
Oh he knows! For the most part.
Yeah, maybe.
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
What's in the bag?
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
'Kay.
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
May I ask why?
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
Hey.
Ohh!
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
I-I like pizza!
Here we go.
How can you not know which one?
I'm done now.
OK Joey, your bet.
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Yay, okay!
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Yeah, I think we are.
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
No, 'cause he's yummy.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
Wait!
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Oh, look! Look! Look!
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Yeah. Okay.
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
What?
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
What-what are you talking about?!
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
Oh, it's like a skit.
Yeah!
Hi Rob Dohnen.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
Whoo-hoo!
Okay, then what happened?
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
Ooooh, nice.
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh... Milwaukee.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Okay, I'm hearing.
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Just, you know, to see... um.
That's great. Good for you guys.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
Ohhhh.
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Should I not have told you?
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
Radiator.
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
All right, so let's switch.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Who, Josh?
I don't know. Me neither.
That is so sweet, you guys.
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
That would be great. Thank you.
I've found....
No-no! I-I...I found one.
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
Fine, I'll go call her.
Monica had lunch with Richard.
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Okay.
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Okay, let's go running!
I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Oh yeah!
Hey.
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Hey Joey.
Who was that?
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Cool.
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
Feel better?
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Yay!
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Didn't you sleep together?
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Show me the badge again.
Yeah, you too.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
Aww.
Why?
What?!
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Hi...
Oh, is the play over?
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
Yes.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
What's wrong Mon?
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
No, not the used wax.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
With?
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Hey.
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
I'll give you $1 for them.
Noo!
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
it's...
leave...
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Yeah, totally.
Oh God, absolutely.
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Rachel, calm down!
You won't even taste it?
where were you standing?
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Oh God!
No!
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Well, just buy the damn boat!
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Hey!
Just get your nails done?
God, I hope they kick his ass!
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Eh?
Oh, just look at her...
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Are you okay?
Hey!
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Hey!
I would love it if I weren't here!
Good!
Another lie. You have a sickness!
No, no, he hasn't been around.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
I miss Rose.
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Monica, you don't know that.
What?
You're not going?
Hey!
You! An actor?! That's madness!
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Huh!
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Uh-huh.
I know, I'm so excited!
Always.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
'Cause that's just your taste.
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
We want you to marry her!
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
I am.
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
Oh, all right. What did I have?
I'm talking about massages.
Oh yeah?
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Ugh, what's right with them?
Hey!
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Woof, woof.
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
What is that sparkly thing?
All right.
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Ohh, that's too bad!
Hi!
He's holding us back.
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Oh.
Six months.
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Yes! She's very excited about that.
No.
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
Oh my God!
Yep!
Have you seen your guy's body?
Oh, we killed them all.
Hey! Ross!
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
Me too! So happy for them!
Stop it!
Ohh.
Ooh-ohh!
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
So, I figured it out.
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
It's Phoebe.
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Yeah?
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
Yeah!
No! Ooh! Oh my god!
Okay.
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Yeah!
Thank you.
Okayyyyy, open up!
What?!
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
She sells drugs to kids.
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Oh my God!-Eh! Well...
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
Congratulations!
Earl! I'm Phoebe.
So uh, now look at the picture...
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Huh?
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
No.
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
And also, my birthday.
In your atlas!
Uh-huh.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Ooh! Hi!
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
That's not good.
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Look, look!
Hello?
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Hey!
I think on some levels she already knows.
No! No!
What's that smell?
Ohh, yes it would.
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
So when, when do you leave?
Oh my God, I didn't...
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Okay!
What? You'll hi-ya?
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
OK, hi again.
I know, the babies are asleep.
Oh that's right!
Ok, all done.
I know where Minsk is.
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Really?!
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!
He's so funny!
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe you could be my roommate!
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
Me too.
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Hi, guys.
Thanks.
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Okay!
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
But at least the apothecary table is real.
You'll have a last kiss.
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Really?!
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Are you moving out?
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Oh, hey, you guys!
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
No, whatever! Anything!
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Hey!
You should! How is she?
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Hey.
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
I do!
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
But hes falling in love with her.
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
Ben, dinner!
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Oh, yeah!
Hey.
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
I am soo dead.
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
You can't have sex with her!
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Yeah, coffeehouse.
That's right.
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
I surely do!
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
No, answer his.
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Yeah, it's a vase.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
You're-you're what?!
That you don't stop talking about it.
Yeah, right.
It's okay to laugh right?
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
I don't even know how that would work!
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Why, nobody good?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
What?
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Yeah? Why?
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
What?
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
No. But thanks.
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Almost never.
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Ross!
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
What?! Really?!
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Why?
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Shut it down.
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Then keep running.
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
That is a different phone.
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Hey!
Really? You can actually see it?
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
You work with robots!!
DANGER!!!!!
Oh, look what we almost left.
What happened?
Hey!
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
Hey.
Yeah.
Okay, so how do we decide that?
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Okay.
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Hey you guys! Look!
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Hey! Hi!
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Yeah.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
All right.
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Ooh.
The little ones do.
Isn't there a national football league.
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
Great!
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Hey!
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Ross!!!
Hi, you guys.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Oh, I'd say about a month.
There it is!
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Thank you so much.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Ooh! I found it!
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Wow!
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Goodnight.
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Yeah, I understand.
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Hey!
Which is why my answer is yes!
Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God.
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Hello.
I can't believe you did that!
Oh hey! How was your audition?
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
What, what is that?
Yeah?
Why?
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
Oh you are so lucky.
But if...
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
I don't....
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
See there it is right there.
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Oh my God Ross!!
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
Oh, me too!
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
No!
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Hey! I call her!
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
How long has it been since you had sex?
Yeah, okay, my bad.
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Still.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
Ooh, what do I smell?
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
Ooh.
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
Hey! Oh!
What am I gonna do?
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Who's singing?
Okay.
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Okay, they're just talking...
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
They've been quiet for a long time.
No.
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
Shhhh!
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
Yeah.
Oh, what? What was it?
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
Yeah, okay.
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
Hey!
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Oh my God.
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
That's so sweet.
And-and you're using my name!
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
Yes, you're having a boy!
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Uh-huh. Good luck.
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Really?
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
Are you calling me selfish?!
Do you like car games?
I want to see what he wants first.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Yes.
Hey.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
She is gonna hate me.
Okay!
Ohh! I did not get that.
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
How's this?
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Umm, no thank you.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Hey!
And because you're both, you know, white women.
You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
Yeah.
Saved your ass.
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
I don't know. A cowboy theme?
It's like a gift.
Hey!
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
...like a...
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Hey!
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
Yeah!
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
What's a Movement class?
I never had a bike of my own.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Come where?
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Yep. Put more gas in.
Here.
Yeah!
Oh, my, oh!
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
Yeah?
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Oh, then no.
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
No!
Yay!!
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
My guy is well read.
Janice? You called Janice?
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Tell him, tell him.
Yes. Not out loud.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
I know, it is.
Uh-huh, yeah!
Not if I get there first.
Well, it does.
Ooh.
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Yeah. Oooh...
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
Hey!
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Hey!
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
Um-um, um-um.
I mean this poor woman.
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Happy birthday!
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
No.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
What are you doing here?
He just got a divorce right?
Where?
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
No!
What are you wrapping?
Always.
Well, what period is it from?
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Okay.
Ooh! Brian's Song!
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
Much as you are.
Hello.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Very good handshake, good wrist action.
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
I'm gonna get coffee.
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Why do you care?
I can't believe you did this.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Oh my God!
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Or you could end up with everything.
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Definitely!
Oh no!
No, but you can't.
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
Helloo! Oh!
Hey.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
It's not that bad.
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Hey, is Chandler here?
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Bye!
I got it! Mine!
Oh no.
Yes? Yes! Oh.
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
Hi!
Ohh, tough call.
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
This is so great.
Yeah, we went shopping!
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
Okay... Okay.
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Yeah, welcome.
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Oh.
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
Sure.
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Living with you would make me happy.
Thank you.
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Definitely.
Oh.
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
That true, I am flaky.
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
What?
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
Chandler, Chandler.
I do, I believe you.
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Okay!
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
Rachel said that!
Really?! What's your name?
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Uh-huh!
Sorry.
What?! That's the first time today!
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
I-I-I found it interesting.
Hey.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Hey.
What else?
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Oh, okay.
No.
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Hello.
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
This is Patrick.
Okay.
Well, do you see any babies?
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Hey, Monica!
Yeah, no, I understand.
So you're not homesick yet?
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Nah. Not really.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
You know what, that's it, that's it.
Alright, no, we could look at them!
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Sure
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
You too!
Really?! How come?
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Come on, do it.
Hey!
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Really?! Are you sure?
You're making one right now!
Uh, here. What time?
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Oh no, yeah.
...teen!
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
What were you thinking?
How do you know?
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Hey.
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
M-M-Mole people?
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Oh. What's a lurker?
Just calm down woman!
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Oh my God!
Come in.
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Hey!
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
You mean a backup?
Uh huh. Why is that?
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
No. No food with a face.
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
It worked!
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Oh! You have a window!
So how was, how was your date?
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Yeah, I don't know.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Does he know?
Monica!
Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
I know. Hand me a tissue.
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
Hey.
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Hey sweetie!
So, what happens to the old guys?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Of course, yeah!
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Hi!
Hey.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
I just asked you.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
Well, I never call me.
Hi Ginger.
Oh, that is better.
That's a bird!
Really?
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Oh yeah, so you know D?
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Chuck Woolery?
I, OK....
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
What do you mean, comforted her?
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Hey!
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
I could've been killed I hope you know!
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
Oh my God!
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
Not after this!
Yeah, you wish!
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Really?
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
It's...
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Yes!!! Oh!!
Um-hum.
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Okay.
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Two?
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Uh-huh.
But we have to!
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
Look, look, I have elbows!
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Ohh! You made up!
Your getting married?!
Oh, okay.
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
I am definitely gonna watch that!
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Okay!
Hey!
Ohh. What is this?
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
I have plans.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Oh my God, so do I!
That's my first name.
Marcel?
Oh! Oop!
Oh, you're such a cheater!
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
Wait a minute.
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
We stand firm at $10.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
I'll get it.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
How about we talk about this over dinner?
Remembered what?
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
I could be a secretary.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
Um, cake.
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Yeah!
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Yeah. What?!
And, and!
Why is Ross doing that?
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
Or not, whatever.
Oh, oh, good.
That's not mine.
Yeah, yeah I got that.
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
That's too hard. Too hard!
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
Oh.
Central... Park!
Hey!
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
Hmm, bummer.
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Hey!
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
Bye!
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
I'm fine, thanks.
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
What'd I say?
Cups? You're giving me cups?
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Works on you.
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Oh, have a great wedding!
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
Rachel?
The coins have finally forgiven me!
Hey.
Yeah.
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh.
Oh, hey!
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
You ok?
There you go!
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Okay, bye.
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Because I cared enough to lie!
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Yeah?
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
Oh!
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
Really?
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
Morly Safer.
No-no, let me in!
Okay.
Hey!
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know...
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
...Then I've already seen this one!
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Okay.
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
You make it so funny.
Hi!
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
I know! Robin is so gay!
Oy!!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
G'night, bro.
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Thanks, Ross.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Okay! Okay! Okay!
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
All right, you know Paolo?
What?
Hey!
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Hey you guys, guess what?
Good.
Who the hell are all these people?
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
We want the last six years back!!
"You wish."
Hey!
Oh.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Are you sure?
Oh, okay.
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Hey!
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
I don't know!
I'm sorry.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Oh, you just know.
Alex Trebek?
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
Dumbass!
Hi.
They're not even touching the lasagna!
What happened?
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Oh, okay, oh.
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Least of all you.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Thanks!
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
Oh God!
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
Hi.
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Hi Paul!
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Isn't he good?
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Sure.
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
Say what?
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Where were you?
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Hey.
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Sure.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Did you find the dress?
That's what you think.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
You betcha!
Please!
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
What, that's it?
Gary.
Good.
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
It's Monica's bed. What?
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, sweetie, oh.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
You ate meat! You had sex!
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Hello?
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Sir! No sir!
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
Ohh, uh-huh so much!
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Right, like the kind you...
Hey!
Watch this.
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Why?
You have the power to do that?
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
What is this?
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Mailbox.
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
How do you know about this?
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Ross says hi.
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Weee!!!
Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
What was that?
Yes.
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
What?
I can't believe you... ..did this.
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Good for you!
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
Ross, I know what you're thinking.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Okay, how do you feel now?
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Thanks Monica!
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Secret affair!
Ooh, God it looks bad.
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
Should we do something?
She seems fine now.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Ok, I'm in the book.
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Well, that could've been really awkward.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Why don't you ask him out?
Oh my God! That's David!
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
How many beeps?
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Are you serious?!
Hey Rachel?
Trouble?
Well then, you should look with us.
Guys, I'm happy too.
What?!!
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
Oh yeah, that's over.
Did he mention us?
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Hi Monica.
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Hey!
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Right, okay, um-mm.
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Mr. President.
Oh my God!!
Hey.
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
Okay, it's in spasm.
Oh, but I can't do that-
Feburary 16th.
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
Uh, I don't think so!
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Hey.
Yes! Oh no!
You guys, he's beautiful!
Yeah?
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Good idea!
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
It's so good. Oh, thanks.
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
Oh!
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Oh my God!
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Neither.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Yeah. See?
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Hey!
Because you're marrying him!
What are you gonna do?
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
Thank you!
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
No! It's nice!
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
Ahh.
Yeah.
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
That's what I said.
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Okay, bye!
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
'Kay, bye!
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
No.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Oh, ok bye-bye.
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
That is damning evidence.
How come?
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
So what's going on?
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
Nesele Toulouse.
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
What?
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Oh!
London is stupid! Stupid!
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Do the claws again.
No, nothing.
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Oh, really?
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.

Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Oh.
Monica.
What were you modeling for?
Okay.
Hi, Ursula.
I know what time you said.
Maybe there's someone else.
Well, I can't help you.
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
I was in charge of cups.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Hey Rach!
Yay me.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Because I think it means more to you.
'Kay, put your head back.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
I know. Use it.
But.
Whatever.
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
I'm totally getting it!
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Thank you.
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Hi.
Oh.
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Okay.
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Like a date type person?
I really do, yeah.
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
'My scones.'
Who is it?
I see.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Hey, dude!
Minsk?
Ooh!
Hey!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
So did Heldi show you the place?
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Thank you, Monica.
Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Me too.
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
So, did you pick one yet?
Oh.
Hi guys!
Then do Iceberg!
Get in here!!!
Ohh, impressive.
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
Ewww!!!
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Yeah!
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Okay! Okay, ready?
Sure!
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
Well, you know that psychic I see?
Hi!
Already?!
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Left! Thank you.
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
All right, I'm sorry.
Now what is Fabutec?
Umm, oh, about three months.
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Count for what?
Wh-what do we do?
She's right! You have to stop!
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
Yeah! You're the best!
A couple hours.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
No-no, we do it every year!
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
I got no sleep last night!
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Yeah!
Yeah?
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
That's a bird?
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
How? How is your fault?
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Ewwww!!
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Maybe it was the guy.
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
Hey!
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Because it's my apartment!
Nah-ha!
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Oh!
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
I won! I won! I finally won!
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
Hey!!
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
Oh, how did it go?
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Tell him it's for you.
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
This is so cool!
You got me.
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
What are you doing?
Well when can we have this shower?
I don't want to hear about her!!
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
What?
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
What is that?
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
I do too.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
Oh, I know.
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
I don't know.
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Why?
You're still gonna go out with her?!
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
On the touchy.
Not for you.
Oh!
Watch, watch.
Um you, you got a minute?
Oh good, you're all up.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Thanks.
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Ah!!
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Then why did she ask us to...
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
I can hop.
Well, I think I can help you get over him.
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
Hi.
Duh!! Christmas!
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
Not a good day for birds...
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
Really?! I won!
My guy has great teeth!
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
I can't!!
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Okay.
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Yeah.
Hi!
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Well then I think that's it.
What?
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
No you didn't!
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Uh-huh.
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
No.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Nope.
Destiny.
You told me.
Well, this is none of my business.
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
No! Coins hate me!
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Oh.
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Hey!
That is.
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
Hm?
Why? What happened now?
It's okay. How's the soup?
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
I, I, I'm hideous.
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
I don't get it.
Uh-hmm.
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Okay.
I'm in.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
And-and a power tie?
Hey!
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
Thank God.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
No. I've learned my lesson.
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Ooh, let's see it!
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
Yeah! What are you saying?
So how did you know Francis?
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Hello? Hey Joey!
What?
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Oh.
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Right- where we've been looking all night!
Really?
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
No, there's no dog here?
That's him.
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Paolo made a pass at me.
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Chandler.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Does Joey have any idea?
Sorry Jill.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Oh my God!!!
Well, then...Let's.
32.
I don't know.
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
I thought you knew that.
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Joey? What's going on?
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Go for it.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just...
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
This stuff is great!
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Okay, let's talk outside.
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
No that is the last thing you want to do!
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Aren't you gonna go?
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
please...
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Chandler?
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
What make you think I can?!
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Lotsa things.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Hey.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Oh, give it to me.
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
What did you do on yours?
They're gonna call her Chandler.
Here. Y'know, just in case.
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
I hope it's you.
Yeah.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
OK, is this really my father?
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Yeah, me either.
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Listen, um...
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
Hey.
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
And you're so sweet. And you're kind
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Oh no.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
What-what's up?
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
I know! I know! I know!
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
Hey!
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
A little bit, yeah.
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
I don't know what to do with that.
What is that?
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Oh me too.
That's right.
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
Me too.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Hey.
So talk to her.
Okay, it's okay.
Ahh, his work is done.
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Open bar?
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
One of the babies is kicking.
Yeah!
You won't let go?
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
She was?
So, what should you have done?
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Hey nice boobs.
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
What does the sign say?
Vince is a fireman.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
I'm going to let him.
Yeah, kinda.
Well, we should go.
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
No.
Oh, please!
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Hey, why don't you?
So now what's going on here?
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
My God! What did you order?!
Not that often!
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Ok, that's so nice.
Ross, where did you get this?!
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
All right. Bye bye.
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
How did that happen?!!
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
I've never done that.
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Whatever! What about you Meg?
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
And the big one's for me!
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
Ohh! No.
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
No, look, don't touch that!
All right, so what were you thinking?
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Oh, thank you.
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
Oh yeah, right now.
That's fun.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Oh no.
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
I know.
I love it!!
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
Ok, all right.
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Will you get us better gifts?
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Are you crazy?
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
Wh-why is that the best part?
Yes.
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
Yeah. Here you go.
See, he's her lobster.
Oh, that sucks!
Yeah.
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Oh! Yeah!
Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?
What else do they add smell too?
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Sells drugs to kids.
Ohhh.
I love Vegas!
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Ohhh.
Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
Definitely!
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
So tell me about this girl?
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Please.
That chick can't handle my corner.
Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
You don't play the oboe!
Umm, a flea market?
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
Really? From who?
You have chalk on your face.
What are you doing?
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.
Ok.
Ewww!
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
You wanna do it right now?
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Potato, Potaato.
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Oh my God. What happened?
But I can't tell you.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
