No. I've learned my lesson.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
Oh, hi Ross!
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
What?!
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Nice!
Hey!
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
No.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
'Kay.
And-and a power tie?
Oh, okay.
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Well, it's better than us deciding.
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Does it look like a urinal?
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
I know, I took it hard too.
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Ick, you were eavesdropping.
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Don't interrupt me!!
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Um-um, um-um.
Oh, how'd that happen?
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Uh... yay!
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Oh God, absolutely.
That sounds great!
Yeah. Here you go.
Still.
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Hey!
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
No, answer his.
Does it look like an ashtray?
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
Because you're marrying him!
Yes.
I don't know what to do with that.
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Oh, okay.
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
No, sorry.
Ross!
See, I didn't know that.
Yeah, what's your point?
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Central... Park!
I am definitely gonna watch that!
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
I've found....
Hey, did she buy it?
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Thank you.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
We're all right.
Nah. Not really.
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Jason?
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Oh good!
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
This is everybody. This is Ross.
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Would you care to venture one?
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Okay, who's next?
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Hey!
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Well, this is none of my business.
I think she would like that.
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Bye.
Uh-hmm.
Oh hi!
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
and...
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Uh-huh.
That chick can't handle my corner.
Go! Go! Go!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
All right, the seven of us miss you.
Good choice.
Just calm down woman!
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
She's right! You have to stop!
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Mr. President.
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Fun Bobby is so great.
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Who's Barney.
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
What umm, what happened?
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Uh-huh!
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Wow, cute one!
Okay, your highness.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Okay, bye!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
Sorry. How about over here?
God!
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
No.
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
Well, just buy the damn boat!
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
That doesn't lock does it?
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
No.
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
So how are things going with you?
Hey!
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Oh thank you.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
Hey! Look who I found!
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Duh!! Christmas!
Fine! Be murky!
Yeah.
Well, I think I can help you get over him.
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Hey!
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Oh, I'd say about a month.
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
Okay!
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Why not?
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Hey!
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
Maybe it was the guy.
Yeah, coffeehouse.
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
It starts?
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Wait, you can't take the money out.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Ross?
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Not that often!
You guys!! Come on!
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Oh hey! How was your audition?
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Aren't you gonna go?
So, I figured it out.
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
What do you know?!
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
Oh.
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Yeah! You're the best!
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Oh yeah.
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
The next, next?
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Hey!
Hi.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
Everything you've heard is true.
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
Bye!
Why, nobody good?
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Hey!
Alright, whadyou do with him?
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Hey nice boobs.
Oh, Chandler funny?
Okay.
Wow.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Ok, thanks.
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Yeah! Okay.
Hi!
Isn't he good?
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
You should! How is she?
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Oh!!
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Of course!
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
Nope.
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Alrighty, here come the water works.
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
You tired Chandler?
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Okay, then what happened?
Oh, you just know.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
You two will have very hairy children.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
This is great!
Interesting.
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Oh.
Hi Monica.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
That is a different phone.
And a glass of tepid water.
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Why?!
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Naked alone time.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Your nails.
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
How do you feel?
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
Go for it.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
It's not that bad.
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
So what are they doing?
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
Why?
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Ohh!
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Whatever! What about you Meg?
Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
I got it! Mine!
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Oh, poor baby.
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Hey.
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
Seriously, what-what's the part?
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Yeah, it was really hard.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Oh, just look at her...
Okay.
None the less.
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
What'd I say?
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
Um, cake.
Oh-my-God!
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Yeah, okay, my bad.
What happened?
Oh my God! Is that him?
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
'My scones.'
We want you to marry her!
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Joey.
Ohh!
Oy!!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
They're gonna call her Chandler.
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Okay.
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
Sure.
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
How'd he take it?
Yeah. Okay.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Left! Thank you.
Hey!
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
You were supposed to tell her!
Really?
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Oh.
All right, you know Paolo?
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
But why does it even matter?!
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Hi, Ursula.
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
Hey!
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
Oh! Yeah!
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Well, he made a move on me.
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
Oh, so, how are we doing?
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Nothing. Nothing.
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Hey.
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Really?
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
Janice? You called Janice?
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
You make up songs?
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
I love this game!!
What? You'll hi-ya?
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Well, then...Let's.
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Yeah.
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
...teen!
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
What?!
Oh, is the play over?
Aww, Pheebs.
What are you gonna do?
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
You're-you're what?!
Which time?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
You did the right thing.
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Hi!
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Yes.
I'll have coffee.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Well hey, it's just a backup.
Yeah, he's gotta go.
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
What?
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Oh my God!
Least of all you.
Really?
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
Definitely.
This is Monica.
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
Hey.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Almost never.
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
And this?
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Oh my God!
Tell him, tell him.
They are gonna love me.
My Saturn dealership.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Ok, all right.
Ross?
Yes? Yes! Oh.
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
Okay. No. But thanks.
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Shut it down.
Marcel?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
I know.
Huh!
I am shocked! Shocked!!
Hey.
There he is! There he is!
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
These old things.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Sure!
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Ross, where did you get this?!
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Swear?!
Hi!
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
All right, I can't wait!
Okay, it's in spasm.
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Yeah?
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
God Joey, this is taking forever!
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
I'm just helping the kids!
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Yeah.
That's too much. Sorry.
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Jack!! Hey!
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
Hey!
Oh, that's beautiful.
Who said you were?
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
What is that?
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Really?! Are you sure?
Hey Rach.
I love it!!
Oh you are so lucky.
Hey!
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Nesele Toulouse.
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Ohh, yes it would.
Ha. Ha, ha.
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Ameri-can.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
No! Ooh! Oh my god!
What was that?
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Huh?
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
I think maybe, yeah.
Oh, thank you.
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Yay me.
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
Our mom.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
I stepped in something icky.
Ooh, uh...
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
So did you ask him?
All right, what's going on there?
Sure.
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Oh.
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
No, whatever! Anything!
That's a good idea for a business!
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Always.
Okay.
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Oh Willie's still alive!
Shh! Get me out of here.
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
That might work!
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
I know.
What are you saying?!
Sing!!
But...
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
You missed a belt loop.
So, what should you have done?
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
I could be a secretary.
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
Ooh-ohh!
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
You guys!
So you're not homesick yet?
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Ewww!!!
Ooh!
Okay.
Sure
Please!
No. No food with a face.
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Oh no, how?
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Maybe nobody's tried this.
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Oh, have a great wedding!
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Oh, it's not!
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Ewwww!!
Hey!
You don't play the oboe!
How's this?
Ooh! I found it!
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Shut up!
I might have.
Oh sure! Noo!
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
Oh, which museum?
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
Well, maybe 25-26.
So how are things going with Paul?
Oh my God!!
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Hey!
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Do it!
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Oh, hello liar.
Nothing-Why?!
Okay.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
Wow!
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Your mom was arrested?
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Nooo! Why would you think that?
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Huh?
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
You won't even taste it?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
That's right.
Then change it back!
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
I'm sorry, who's this?
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
It's not that bad.
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Really?! Really?!
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
Who is it?
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Oh, fine! Take his side!
Oh, I...
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Yes! She's very excited about that.
Oh no! Why?
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Oh.
Bye!
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Thanks.
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Oh, I see.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Hey.
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Oh, my.
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Okay, let's go running!
Hi.
Well you don't.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Oh he's like a...
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
That's what I said.
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
So now what's going on here?
Okay.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
London is stupid! Stupid!
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Oh my God!
You know who shaved you? That was me.
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
All right.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
Really?!
Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Oh yeah, like you never called!
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
You won't let go?
Okay, let's talk outside.
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
Oh!
Does he know?
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
Oh.
What is it?
Yeah!
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
I don't think you mean that.
Give it!
Okay!
We have good news, look whose back!
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Yes!!! Oh!!
I can't believe you caved.
No!
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
Okay.
Hi.
17 years ago.
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
No-no, let me in!
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Oh, is this the bug lady?
There he is!
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
Yeah.
You said I was boring--Ohh!
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
I've never done that.
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
Hi!
Oh good.
: Your Visa bill is huge!
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Yeah?
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
What?
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Hey Joey.
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
The little ones do.
I'm coming! I'm coming!
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Oh God.
Two?
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Are you the cutest?
Yum-my!
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
They have the best stuff in there.
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
What?!
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
How close?
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
You ok?
Oh, it's like a skit.
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
Guys, I'm happy too.
What?
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
Chandler, Chandler.
That's what you think.
Garfunkle.
Oh, hey!
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Oh, yeah, right.
I want to see what he wants first.
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
And this is Rachel.
You wanna do it right now?
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
Fired! Why?
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Oh.
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
Radiator.
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Maybe on some level.
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
So when, when do you leave?
Potato, Potaato.
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
I'll give you $1 for them.
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
All right, so let's switch.
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Oh hey!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
Absolutely!
That was my dad!
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
Well, that could've been really awkward.
Okayyyyy, open up!
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
What?!
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
A birthday party.
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Okay.
I'm going to let him.
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
OK.
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Sure.
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Oh my God, so do I!
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Why are you being weird?
Are you crazy?
Rachel, calm down!
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
please...
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Like a date type person?
Ohh, you're a freak!!
What?
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
You're there!
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
Yeah, I don't need it.
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
You know her?!
Oh, then no.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
Hey!
Yeah, no, I understand.
Hey!
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
I know.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
No.
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Thank you.
Well that's great! Congratulations!!
Hey!
Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Hey!
Hey!
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Yeah.
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Hey sweetie!
Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
What else?
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Hey!
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
What-what's up?
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
No.
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Oh, en chante.
No, look, don't touch that!
Oh, you're such a cheater!
Chandler, Chandler.
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Yeah absolutely!
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
What is this?
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Oh, I couldn't go in.
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Okay. See?
Oh!
Okay whatever.
Oh, I'll get it.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Then do Iceberg!
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Just kidding!
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
That's too hard. Too hard!
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
I love Vegas!
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Oh, my, oh!
Oh.
Yeah.
Aw, dammit!
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Yeah?
Hey!
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
Oh yeah, come here.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
I helped!
No-no! I-I...I found one.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
Your getting married?!
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Hey!
Wow. Thank you.
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Ooh, what do I smell?
This is Patrick.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
Yeah, I've been around.
...like a...
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
Hi!
Hey!
No kind. He just makes it up.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
You ate meat! You had sex!
Nope.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
What were you modeling for?
Really?
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Yay!
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
I was in charge of cups.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Oh hey!
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Are... are you OK?
Oh, that sucks!
Whatcha doin'?
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Ooh.
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
OK, is this really my father?
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
No, you have to let me in right now!!
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
I, OK....
Ooh, it's not bad.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Oh my God!-Eh! Well...
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
I know. This is really, really huge.
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
And why not?!
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Ohhh, wow.
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
How much was it?
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
Chandler.
Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Oh.
Oh, this guy again.
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Yeah, you too.
Yes, but I'm doing this.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Oops!
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
What do you mean?
...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Okay, there.
Yeah.
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Because it's my apartment!
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Lusts of the flesh.
Hey.
Ok so will he be back soon?
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
What about my cab?
I'm not asking!
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
I love the license plate game!
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
He could be in disguise, y'know.
Okay.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Me too.
No. Why?
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Me?!
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
Yep!
Bye!!!
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.

Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Oh!
What is your job?
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
I don't have time for this.
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Well, it felt French.
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Hey!
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
In your atlas!
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
What?
Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Oh.
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
No.
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
Oh, let me see!
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Yeah!
Okay.
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Oh, okay.
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
That true, I am flaky.
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
There you go.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Hi, you guys.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
I'm in.
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Oh no.
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Yeah! What are you saying?
Intense and creepy.
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Ow! Ow!
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
That's what I'm saying.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
Dance karate?
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Oh, the Olympics.
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
He shot a bird!
Oh.
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
Oh, that's fine, no.
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Oh no.
Ooh, I like cards.
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Good for you!
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Just kidding. Ahh!
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
You! An actor?! That's madness!
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
Oh, right!
Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
Yeah?
Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
What?!!
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Yes. Not out loud.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Yay!
Maybe there's someone else.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
What?
She wants to meet you in person.
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Uh-huh!
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
I guess so.
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
Oh my God!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
No-no!! No!!
Rachel has a new doll.
Mmmm hmmm.
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Sure.
Hi!
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Nope, not knocked up yet.
Hi, so what happened?
Nooo!!
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Really?!
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Uh-huh, what?
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
OK.
Hey.
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
Can you hear anything?
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Oh, you're not a dingus.
I just feel so, uhh.....
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
Yeah.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Where's Chandler?
Hi.
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
This is Patrick.
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
All right, Joey, same question.
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
Ok.
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Well, so do a lot of people.
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Hey!
Yummy noises.
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
I had one.
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Okay.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Ooooh, nice.
Hey.
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
Yeah. What?!
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
Here. Y'know, just in case.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
I really do, yeah.
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Hey! What are you doing here?
Yeah?
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
I don't know.
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Yeah, why not?
Which one do you have?
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
What?! No! It was my idea!
Oh! No problem! I...
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
All right. Good luck.
Uh huh. Why is that?
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
I don't....
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
I know. Use it.
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Really?
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Good! Good! Five points!
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Um, do you wanna sit?
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
You said it was okay!
Fauna.
You know what, that's it, that's it.
You ate meat! You had sex!
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
I guess.
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Oh! Oop!
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Hey hey hey! She's on!
No!
Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
What?!
Hey!
I got no sleep last night!
What?!
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
Watch this.
Okay, scarf's done.
You didn't read this one either?!
Yeah, but you always say that.
Rachel?
What?
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
What?! That's the first time today!
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Eh?
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
Oh my God!
No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
You make it so funny.
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Maybe your scene's coming up?
Oh, I know.
Go ahead.
It's gone.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
How did you do that?
Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!
Huh?
How can you not know which one?
Not yet, no.
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
But hes falling in love with her.
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Come on, do it.
Enh. Sure!
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
I don't get it.
Huh?
Do I?
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
Ooh.
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Oh good!
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
I don't know. Me neither.
Oh. Uh, I'm on.
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Yeah, me, too, technically.
In my day, divorce was not an option.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
You guys, he's beautiful!
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
Hey.
Ehh!!
Really?!
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Yep. Put more gas in.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
Hey!
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
Thank you, Monica.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Joey? What's going on?
Oh, look! Look! Look!
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
Oh, really.
What?
I-We gotta get Monica.
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Oh my God. What happened?
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
Really? From who?
Yay!!
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Well, it's going okay.
I see what you're doing!
Ohh, uh-huh so much!
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Well, we both have.
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Ewww!
What does the sign say?
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
I know! I know! I know!
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
So how was, how was your date?
Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
What?
Fine, I'll go call her.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Rifts. Yeah, I know.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Man alive!
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
Hey!
I got it.
Well, I am.
Hi.
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Okay, Widow!
Watch, watch.
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
What are you wrapping?
Okay!
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
The little jail between the doors!
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Count for what?
Yeah.
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
Bye!

But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
No!
A chin dimple!
Cups? You're giving me cups?
Of course, yeah!
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
What else do they add smell too?
Okay.
Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Hi.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Oh yeah, that's over.
Ohh, that's too bad!
Would she?
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Yeah.
You have the power to do that?
Ohh, impressive.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh-huh.
It's like a gift.
With?
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
There's no dog in here.
And then... your face is bloated?
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Can I tell you a little secret?
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
Which Richard?
Joey's!
No! Coins hate me!
What's in the bag?
Hi Paul!
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Yeah.
Oh God!
Do the claws again.
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
So, what happens to the old guys?
No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
Yes, I will tell her.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Give it.
Yeah.
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
And the big one's for me!
Ross, I know what you're thinking.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Fine.
Sure.
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
Hmm, bummer.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
Here.
Thank you.
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Great! Okay, good for you!
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
You have your birth certificate?
My roommate.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
It's nice that he has someone.
Okay.
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Okay that's so generous!
I don't have it!
That's a defense?
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
Feburary 16th.
Isn't he great?
Hey.
Listen, um...
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Hello?
Floopy?
Hi.
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
Okay, London 1...
What are they?
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Uh-huh.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
Who was that?
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Uma Thurman.
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Why? Why would you do that?
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
You told them he was missing?
Hey, dude!
Oh!
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
Oh that's right!
Yeah.
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
Ohh! You made up!
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
So, here we are. Nervous?
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
Wow!
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Yeah, I don't know.
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Oh my God Monica!
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
What make you think I can?!
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
Yeah!
You really thought it was perfect?
So... and?
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Oh God!
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Wh-wh-what are you doing?
I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.
Well, you know that psychic I see?
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Um you, you got a minute?
What?
No, no, it's just my tooth.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
No.
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
And call me!
I don't ever want to see you again!
I'll get it.
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Living with you would make me happy.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
Yeah, you never heard of them?
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
All right, I'm sorry.
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
Hey!
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
Huh.
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Oh!
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
No, don't look directly at them!
Why?!
Yeah.
Hey!
No!
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Nu-uh!
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Hi, so what happened?
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Yes! Oh no!
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Oh, hi.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Well, I can't help you.
Totally.
Oh, I get a puppy!!
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Ok.
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
How about we talk about this over dinner?
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
How? How is your fault?
Yeah, I do, yeah.
That won't go with this dress though.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
Uh-huh.
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
You never run on a barge!
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
What were you thinking?
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
About what?
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
So...Thank you.
Oh my God.
Susan, he looks just like you.
I don't know. A cowboy theme?
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Waxine!!
John?
Yes, good! Ok...
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
There it is!
We were out of Doritos.
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Trouble?
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Hey!
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
Yeah?
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Yeah?
Okay.
Oh, thanks!
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
I don't know! I don't remember!
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
I don't want to hear about her!!
But we have to!
Is he alright?
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
Just, you know, to see... um.
Well, what did he do?
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
What are you saying I should do?
Yeah!
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
No-no, we do it every year!
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Oh well y'know.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
What?
Stay.
And who else is going to be there?
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Now what is Fabutec?
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Both!
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Feel better?
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
Wait here. Breathe.
You just said...
Umm, oh, about three months.
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
God, what a mess.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Huh?
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
How long has it been since you had sex?
Chandler?
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Really?! How come?
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
I think it's important that you do.
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
32.
Monica!
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Uh-huh.
I'd call that excessive.
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
'Kay, bye!
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
Ohh! No.
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
Well... It's a date.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Hey.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Good.
Okay everyone, think thick.
Two.
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
I guess it was kinda funny.
Thanks! So are you.
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
What?
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Hey!
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
What?
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Oh, no.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Alright. So um, stilts huh?
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
So that story doesn't make you cry?
Really?!
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Oh my God.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
Your own boat?
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Oh.
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
You told me.
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
Yeah!
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Is it a meatball sub?
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Yeah, I understand.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Look, look, I have elbows!
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
Hey! Ross!
Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
Ohhh!!!
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
What?!
Hey!
Because she's your lobster.
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
So did Heldi show you the place?
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
We could have breakfast in bed...
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Didn't you sleep together?
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Yeah.
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
How many beeps?
Oh!
Thank you.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
We stand firm at $10.
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
What's going on?
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
So. You two are totally into each other.
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Hi.
I'm sorry.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Why not her?
Oh.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Hey!
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
You got me.
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
Hi, guys.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Let's run towards them!
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
That's great Joe!
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Hey.
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Dumbass!
But she just came up here!
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Hey!
Oh, hey, you guys!
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
The name was my favourite part!
Hi!
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Thank you! I know, though.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
It's Ross.
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
Thinkin' about it.
Oh my God!
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
Oh yeah!
Really?! What's your name?
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
You have a third nipple?
She's a waitress.
Ross!!!
Thanks!
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Oh, they love your casserole.
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
Oh yeah.
Yeah
What's wrong Mon?
Don't even get me started on yours!
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
What?!
You'll have a last kiss.
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
You cook naked?
YOU KNOW?!!!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
What-what are you talking about?!
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Well, what period is it from?
Hey!
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Hey, what's going on?
Yeah, you wish!
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
Paul.
We should do something. Whistle.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Uh-hmm.
Ooh, who's it for?
What?!
What?!
Oh. Hey!
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
Lilly's dead.
Me too. Rachel.
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
Chandler.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
Janice.
Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Yes! Very good.
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
I don't even know how that would work!
Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
Wherere you going?
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
It isn't?
Okay.
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Hey.
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh, please!
Which proves that I never lie.
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
Neither.
Yeah, totally!
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Our apartment is ready.
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Did you find the dress?
And you're so sweet. And you're kind
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
What about this?
Then keep running.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Oh good, you're all up.
Okay.
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Yeah?
No, we never do that
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Oh, okay, oh.
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Hi!
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Hummus. I got the hummus.
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
Should we do something?
This is so cool!
Yeah, me either.
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
Like what?
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Hi Rob Dohnen.
Definitely!
Hey!
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Um-hum.
How do you know?
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
Yeah!
Not after this!
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Hi Joey.
So what's going on with you?
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Hey, Monica!
God, what happened?!
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Goodnight.
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
What?
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
No! Why?
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Where were you?
Okay.
Oh, okay then.
Yeah me too.
I did, but that was really fun.
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Okay.
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
No!
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
That's weird.
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Yeah, swing music is so out.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
Oh. Oh.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Yes, please.
I, I, I'm hideous.
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
That's not good.
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Come on, take 'em off!!
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
No, nothing.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Ooh! Oh!
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Really?
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Hi!
Okay.
What am I gonna do?
I know, I know. Hello.
Come on! Look where you are!!
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
Why?
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
She sells drugs to kids.
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
Please.
I'm sorry.
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Rachel? Um, hi.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Already?!
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
Hey!
Say what?
Oh my God!
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
So nothing got ruined?
Yeah?
You're still gonna go out with her?!
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Yeah, no, it was great.
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Yeah?
Ok, you weren't there.
Thanks!
Yeah, okay.
Oh, all right. What did I have?
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
He's holding us back.
Uh-hmm.
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Hey.
Bye, fat ass.
Please...wait, how did you do that?
Have you seen your guy's body?
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
Maybe, because you told him not to.
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Uh-huh!
I do, I believe you.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
Why?
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Well, I never call me.
Knock, knock, knock.
Shiny.
On the touchy.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
My God, Joey!
Ah!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
What do you mean, comforted her?
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Thanks.
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
We will give you $10.
A little bit, yeah.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Where are you going?
Yeah, this has happened before.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.
Hey!
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
One of the babies is kicking.
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
So talk to her.
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
Hey!
Look, look!
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Hey!
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
Well, we should go.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
They are. Why?
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Here.
Hello.
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Whattaya mean?
Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
Ooohh, why?
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
Ow!!!
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Petrie.
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Joey.
What are we going to do?!
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
I don't know.
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
You sound like a guy.
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
We did have fun, didn't we?
You wanna try it again?
Yeah, right.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
You didn't tell her did you?
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
It's okay to laugh right?
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
All right.
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Ooh, God it looks bad.
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Ok, do you know A minor?
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Okay quick, help me get this off!
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
I can't believe you did this.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
Rachel?
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
Hey Ryan, what's up?
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
The woman who cuts my hair!
Umm, Gene.
I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Oh don't do that.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Rachel.
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
What's going on?
So how long have you known?
What? You mean behind my back?
Vince is a fireman.
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
May I ask why?
So now, what is this now?
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Thank you!
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
Hey!
You work with robots!!
Destiny.
Since when are you into swing music?
Yes!
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
Hey.
No listen to me! She is crazy!
Wooo!! Hoo!!
Yeah!
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Great! Thank you very much.
Congratulations!
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Oh, look at that.
Well, it does.
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Hey!!
What surprise party?
Oh yeah?
Yes.
We thought you knew!
Never mind, I got it.
And, and!
Hey.
Oh.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
So was it a lot more money?
Yeah, okay.
Oh, hi.
No!
No.
Ohh.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Okay. I'm going with you.
Thank God.
Where's Chandler?
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
Thanks!
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
Great!
God, Susan is so fun!
But again, Simmons. Go on.
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
Hee hee!
I know, I'm so excited!
Right, and its me.
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
You're right.
Okay.
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
What?!
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
...Then I've already seen this one!
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Hey, Lizzie.
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Oh my God, I didn't...
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
OK, that's my tattoo.
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
Why?
Ugh, PBS!
Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
What, that's it?
Now, have you told anyone else?
Oh! Oh my God!
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
He's even kind of cute.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Wait, does he eat chalk?
North route or south route?
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
She is so great! I miss her.
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Hey!
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
It's so good. Oh, thanks.
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Really?
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
Okay.
Wow, look at these prices.
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Everything?
What do you mean?
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
I sang. Hah!
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Yeah. Sorry.
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
Hi.
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
I-I sure will, take care.
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
So, um, have you told your parents?
So.
No, I'm fine.
Okay, I'm hearing.
I know. They were mine.
Happy birthday!
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
Hey!
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
No, why?
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Yeah, all right.
Okay, bye!
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
Rachel said that!
Me too!
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
You guys are here! Yay!
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
You too!
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
Nu-uh!
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Oh.
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Kills you?
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
Gum!
I can't believe you... ..did this.
Or you could end up with everything.
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
Rdtor.
No!
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
Okay, I'm ready.
Okay, bye.
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
Bye, Gene.
We're practically kissing.
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Why, what happened?
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
What?!
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
So?
About how good your cards were.
No.
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
I, but you're so close! No!
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Hey.
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Will you get us better gifts?
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
No.
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
YOU KNOW?!!!
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Ohh. . .K. How come?
We're all right.
I can hop.
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
What did he say?
Hey, why don't you?
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Hi Ginger.
Well, I taught me and I love me.
So, did you pick one yet?
Hey!
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
I can't believe this!
...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Yes.
Ok, all done.
What?
Ugh, okay Sherlock!
You'd already broken up.
Hellooo!
It's your thing, and-
I got me some drinks!
Tell him it's for you.
Ugh, what's right with them?
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
it's...
Let's see!
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Why don't you ask him out?
Why?
What's that smell?
I know.
Bye, good luck.
Hi!
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Sure!
No, 'cause he's yummy.
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Good. So what were you thinking?
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Hi!
With what?
Who's singing?
Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Then don't touch one!!
You're Frank's best man?!
What?
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Okay. Bye!
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
Love....
Watching ballroom dancing?
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
Hey!
Thanks.
If!
Oh!
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Well then, you should look with us.
So-so you're really not going?
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Yeah?
Cigarettes?!!
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Oh.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Oh I know.
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Yes.
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Yeah she said something about crumbies.
Well, can you dance at all?
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Oh.
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Yeah!
Hey.
What were you doing?
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Monica!
Okay. Oh, no!
Ooh! That's so nice...
That's him.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Heh?
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Oh, I can still do that.
No.
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Are you alright?
Do it do it do it!
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
I haven't really had any yet.
Not if I get there first.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
I have quarters!
Good.
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Hey.
Um, not even a little bit.
Yeah.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Much as you are.
Yeah.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Hey!
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
Yeah.
Hey!
What is this? What's going on?
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Have you really done this before?
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Okay!
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Oh. What's a lurker?
No it's not, sorry.
Sorry Jill.
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Helloo! Oh!
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Thanks.
Yes! Your honor?
All right, get a room.
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
OK, well then what is this?
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Ohh, get a room.
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Demi Moore.
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
It could be like a big giant guy.
I licked my arm, what?
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
Does Joey have any idea?
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Hey!
What?! Really?!
Hey.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
Who, Josh?
You're actually going through with this?
Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Hey!
I have plans.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
Okay sure!
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Hmm?
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
What? Oh my God!
A couple hours.
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Well, if you think it will help.
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
But.
I can't!!
Nothing! This is not over!
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Marcia and Chester.
Oh, thats good.
No! I do want to!
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
Fine!
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
You know?!
Okay.
No, you?
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Uh-huh, yeah!
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
Ew-eww!! Undies!
What?!
What happened?
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Remembered what?
Half full of looooovvvvve.
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
I don't use a curling iron.
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
What?
The end.
You must be Hilda.
But we've only had one job.
Hey.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Yeah, totally.
Hey! I call her!
You don't like ice cream?
Hey!
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
I, umm, shut up!
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
Oh my God!
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
I think on my shoulder.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
No!
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Should I not have told you?
What?
Hello?
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Hello!
You guys. You suck too.
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Sex in his chair.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
Oh my God!!
Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just...
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
I love Jacques Cousteau!
Hey!
Monica had lunch with Richard.
I'll be waiting.
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Is that a problem?
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
Morly Safer.
All right all ready.
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
Thank you. We both forgive you.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Oh! You got it?!
So, what movie should we see?
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Hey.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Hey!
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
I know.
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
Ok. One.
I know.
What I said you had...
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Nothing, nothing.
Ugh, I hate this year!
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Allison's birthday party.
Hey!
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
What? What?
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Sure! Where is it?
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
What are you talking about?!
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Frank! Hi!
Uh-huh.
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
It's not that bad.
I am soo dead.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Ah!!
Oh, that is better.
Uh.
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
What the hell are you doing?!
You mean a backup?
Thanks Monica!
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
G'night, bro.
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Better. Yeah.
Alex Trebek?
Oh?!
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
No that is the last thing you want to do!
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
I'm having another heart attack!
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
Ok, I'll walk you out.
Yeah. So?
"You wish."
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
It's Monica's bed. What?
And because you're both, you know, white women.
Oh my God, you look so good!
Yeah.
Earl! I'm Phoebe.
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Alright, no, we could look at them!
Monica.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
OOooooo!
Hey!
So how did you know Francis?
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
See there it is right there.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
Yeah. See?
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
But if...
Yeah?
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
Always.
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Any luck?
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Oh.
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Yeah!
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
leave...
She wasn't a hooker.
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
So, do you have any other possibilities?
All right, that's it, I quit.
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
That's so sweet.
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Ohhh!!!
What?! Why?!
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
What is that?
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
What did you do on yours?
There's sooo much you don't know.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
Ok, have a good break-up.
Oh, how did it go?
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
Hi...
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
And also, my birthday.
Hey, how'd it go?
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Oh I just miss him so much!
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Yeah, I actually don't know...
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
Okay, so how do we decide that?
I know.
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Okay.
Yeah.
How'd you know I was coming?
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Ooh! Hi!
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Yes! .... or no.
Chandler.
Okay.
Why is Ross doing that?
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
I am.
Yeah, what town are we near?
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Hm?
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
It is your office.
Whe-where did he put it?!
Oh Chandler!
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
Okay then.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
What?
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
What?
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
That you don't stop talking about it.
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
Hi.
Really?! I won!
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
Oh no, yeah.
No, but you can't.
So is it like art?
Hi.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Okay... Okay.
I can't believe you did that!
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
Pastrami.
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
Oh my God!!!
Ooh, let's see it!
Hey.
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
Are you serious?!
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
Ohh, ohh.
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Ooh, now you lost me.
Hey!
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Really?!
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
Hi Emily!
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Rach, you're in my seat.
Hey.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Right- where we've been looking all night!
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Hey!
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Hey!
Ooh!
No.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
What?
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
You guuuyys.
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
What makes it pilgrim?
Secret affair!
What?! What the hell?!
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Oh, what? What was it?
I'm fine, thanks.
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
Works on you.
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
Isn't there a national football league.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
What kind of an emergency?
Oh my God! That's David!
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Hey.
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
No.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Okay, they're just talking...
Alright, I can get you out.
You wanna work on your interview skills?
What?!
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
I'm having my first contraction!
Do you like car games?
Hello.
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
Hey!
What is that?
You're going to Minsk.
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
Oh, me too!
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
What happened?
Yeah, welcome.
So?
So tell me about this girl?
Oh, yay!
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Oh, yeah!
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Yes!
Oh he knows! For the most part.
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
See, he's her lobster.
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
Hey.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Hey.
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Mailbox.
Ta-da.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Well, he didn't tell me.
Uh-hmm.
Right.
All right, you go.
That's a bird?
You're all invited to bite me!
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
There you go!
On a totally different bet.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Hey, is Chandler here?
Woo-yay!!
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
So what's going on?
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
I'm sorry.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Thank you so much.
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Hey.
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
No! It's nice!
Definitely not his mother.
I know. Hand me a tissue.
Hey!
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
Sure!
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Hey cool, mine too.
Oh, oh! It's on again!
This is so great.
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Ahh, his work is done.
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Hey, what's going on?
Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
How did that happen?!!
Oh.
What's the matter?
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Okay, um, stay.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
The coins have finally forgiven me!
Which you just gave up really quickly.
Oh, really?
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
Oh Ross, hi.
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
I know!
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Oh my God Ross!!
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
No, it's fate!
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Chandler what are you doing?!
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Okay, woo! Hi.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
I miss you too!!!!
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Hm-mmm.
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
That is damning evidence.
Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Yeah?
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
I think it went into me.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
You have chalk on your face.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
Oh no no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
And chili!
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Yeah?
He broke that.
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Drum roll.
Okay.
I'm gonna get coffee.
Don't get me started on that.
Yes, you're having a boy!
She was?
That's my first name.
Oh, yeah. What's this?
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
That would be great. Thank you.
Oh.
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
You know he's gay?
Well then definately don't take his name.
Right, okay, um-mm.
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
Ross?!
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
Why would you kill his fish?
Hey.
Okay.
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Rachel.
Yeah, I think we are.
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Right, like the kind you...
Ooh! Brian's Song!
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Oh my God.
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
No, I want this to happen.
Uh uh.
What's going on?
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Hi.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Oh.
All right, and umm...
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
...Flame Boy.
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
Oh, was I doing it again?
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Duly noted.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Fine. All right, fine.
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Yeah?
Yep!
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
What?!
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
That is so sweet, you guys.
I don't what your talking about.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Got it.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Do you have my birth certificate?
Why?
Ok, I'm in the book.
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
I-I-I found it interesting.
Stick a fork what?
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God.
Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
Ohhhh.
Okey-doke.
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Jason is not a sissy!
My God! What did you order?!
Such a pig!
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
Yeah, kinda.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
These are her earrings.
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
Oh, we killed them all.
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
And why not?!
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Oh, look what we almost left.
DANGER!!!!!
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Ohhh.
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Hi!
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
Did you find it?
I'm sorry.
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Wh-why is that the best part?
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Yay, I rock.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Great.
Ooh.
Well, I hate to eat and run, but...
But you guys came so close.
What's block?
What are you doing?
What?!
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
I got it! Mine!
No, but you're questioning my method!
Okay, listen Robert...
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Ross, thank God.
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Oh my God!
Oh.
Hey! New wallet, huh?
So uh, now look at the picture...
Hey!
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
'Kay, put your head back.
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
I-I like pizza!
Hi!
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
Chandler!!
What?
Open it up, let me see.
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
Hey!
We should help him!
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
All right. Bye bye.
Him? Him, Ross?
Good one! Yeah.
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
No, but he's always late.
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Oh yeah, so you know D?
Wow! I would trade.
Oh, I'd like that.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Hey!
I know what time you said.
Yeah, yeah!
Huh.
Oh!
Wait a minute.
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Okay, quit down.
Hey you guys! Look!
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Are you sure?
I can do that.
What?!
Ooh, absolutely!
Okay.
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Hey!
Definitely!
You can't have sex with her!
And we did.
Oh.
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Okay, it's okay.
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Are you calling me selfish?!
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Yeah!
Yeah? Why?
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
I found it!
Well when can we have this shower?
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
Open bar!
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Yeah!
where were you standing?
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
He just got a divorce right?
Hmm, how about my azzz?
Plate! Yes, plate.
A dollar?
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Yeah, that'd be ok.
Yeah!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
Hey!
Yeah!
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Did he mention us?
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Lotsa things.
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Hey!
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Yeah well, we'll see.
Oh yeah, right now.
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
You're Frank Buffay?
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Okay. Hey Rach?
Okay! Okay, ready?
Okay, how do you feel now?
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
I wa-I wa-I wa...
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Oh, like that's a word.
Okay.
Chuck Woolery?
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
That oughta do it.
Oh.
We could not, would not want to wait.
Yeah.
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
I thought you knew that.
Okay, you wore me down.
Are you crazy?
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
Pat Sajak?
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Hm-mm, corn beef.
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Oh, there they are!
Hey!
I would love it if I weren't here!
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
Thank you.
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Does that mean Carcass is available?
You've never asked a guy out?!!
Just get your nails done?
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
Why not?
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Yeah, yeah I got that.
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
She seems fine now.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
What's a Movement class?
Hello? Hey Joey!
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
Oh no.
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
Not for you.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Yeah?
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Uh-huh, yeah that's right.
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Hey.
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
What, what are they talking about?
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
Maybe you could be my roommate!
Bye.
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Sir! No sir!
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Oh, sweetie, oh.
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Hey.
I am extremely talented!
That's great. Good for you guys.
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
That's fun.
Surprise! Look who's back!
Hey Rachel?
Yeah Im fine.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
That's not mine.
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Y'know what that means?
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Because I think it means more to you.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Hi Monica!
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
I want to keep one.
So? Did you get the annulment?
Uh-huh. Good luck.
Yeah!
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Stilts?
Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Well, he's very charming.
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Fish!
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Really?
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
Monica, in or out?
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
What?
Ok, that's so nice.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Okay.
Oh, ew!
I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Hey.
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
I'm having a really good time!
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
How do you know about this?
You think you know me so well.
See, he's her lobster.
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
That's a bird!
Oh! You have a window!
Hey.
Okay!
Hey you guys, guess what?
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Ohh-oh, chilling!
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
Okay.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
Oh that's not so bad.
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
No! No!
Ahh.
Well then I think that's it.
You're welcome.
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Hey, and then lunch.
You are so smitten.
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Yeah!
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Yeah?
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
Hi!
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
Yeah.
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
I don't know, you might be the first one.
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
It's Phoebe.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
Sur-surprise.
Umm, no thank you.
Yeah, we went shopping!
Bye!
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Hey!
She is gonna hate me.
I'm sorry.
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Oh, just ask him!
Yeah, but not just that.
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Hey Rach!
Hey.
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
No!
Which is why my answer is yes!
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Thanks! Okay.
What is that sparkly thing?
Oh, that's great!!
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Uh, here. What time?
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Ohhh!
I'm in.
Are you moving out?
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Not a good day for birds...
Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Oh.
Okay, but.
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
No thanks, I've already seen one.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
I would love that job!
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Wait!
So did you sleep well last night?
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Hey!
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Hey!
Hi!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Sorry.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
It's okay. How's the soup?
Okay then.
My little brother's getting married!!
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
But I can't tell you.
Monica, you don't know that.
Why do you care?
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
I just asked you.
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
I ate a bug.
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
You're-you're what?!
Why not?!
Hello?
Noooo!!
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Aww.
Cool.
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
Well...
Six months.
It worked!
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Are you okay?
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
Hi guys!
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Your middle name is Pamela?
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
Just for a second.
Oh... Milwaukee.
That is funny.
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Say we are unagi!
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Paolo made a pass at me.
Ewww!
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
Gary.
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Shhhh!
Oh my God!
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
God, I hope they kick his ass!
No!
Open bar?
I could've been killed I hope you know!
My guy is well read.
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
I brought you alphabet soup.
Ewwww!!
Yeah?
Okay!
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
He's so funny!
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
See, we don't need them.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
What am I sitting on?
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
It's James Bond.
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
That is.
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Stop it!
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
I'm still on "no."
Good!
Why? What happened now?
Yeah, maybe.
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Oh my God!
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Ahhh!!
Here we go.
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
OK.
What are you doing here?
Ok.
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
You do?
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
No, there's no dog here?
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Does Joey know?
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Ooh.
Huuh.
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
Well, yeah.
Whoa! I kinda liked it.
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Get in here!!!
Ugh!
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
She's dead.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
Then why did she ask us to...
Ohhh.
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
No. But thanks.
Hi.
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
Well at least we know she's a woman.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
Me too! So happy for them!
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Oh, I have cards!

Uh-huh.
It's Phoebe.
Yeah?
Oh, me too!
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
Congratulations!
Minsk?
Hi.
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
No, Joey.
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
Please, I think you know why.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Wh-what do we do?
Oh no.
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
Noo!
Come on, like you never talk that.
Yeah.
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Whatever.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
Uh, I don't think so!
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
I've had better.
Okay.
You're pregnant!
Nah. I kept myself busy.
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Why?
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
No I didn't!
I'm totally getting it!
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
OK Joey, your bet.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
I won! I won! I finally won!
Sells drugs to kids.
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Yeah.
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Oh man.
No, I can spot you from here.
I can do that for the kids.
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
That's right.
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Oh. Oh!
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
No! No, the robots just work for them.
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
Oh.
Do you want a refill?
Okay.
Come in.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
Yeah, come to papa.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Hey.
Thanks you guys! Again.
Hey!
Apology accepted.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
What?
No, not the used wax.
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know...
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
Yeah.
That play?
Yeah!
I could do that.
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
No, but let's come back to that later!
Hey.
No that made me feel precious.
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
You didn't get the money, did you?
and...
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
Really? You can actually see it?
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
You are just like Jack.
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
Na-uh, I am!
Hey!
What?
That and arrogance.
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
Doing it on this table.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
But I like it here!
Umm, a flea market?
Yeah!
I know where Minsk is.
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
Bye you.
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
I saw it.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
I mean this poor woman.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...
Why?
It's...
You're making one right now!
Okay.
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Gunther, kiss me.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Wow!
Okay?
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Hey!
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
They were threefold.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Ohh!
Oh, sly.
Are you still mad at us?
Umm, yeah! Today's.
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
Hey!
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Oh, ok bye-bye.
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
OK, hi again.
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Hey!
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Oh, well, actually.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Or not, whatever.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
And-and you're using my name!
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
Well, how much do you think he needs?
Well, do you see any babies?
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Uh-huh.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
Nah-ha!
I think on some levels she already knows.
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Aww, good. What?
Could you speak up please?
Oh my god! Where are you?
You're not going?
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
Okay!
Get in here!!!
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
M-M-Mole people?
Yeah!
No, I do not hear that.
Thanks, Ross.
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
OK, let's go.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Yeah.
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
All right, so what were you thinking?
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Yeah!
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
What are you talking about?
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Ooh, erotiery!
Ohh! I did not get that.
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Hey.
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
Hey, you're early.
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Me too.
Yeah, it's a vase.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
I don't know!
Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Yeah. Oooh...
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Hey.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
Me too.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
But at least the apothecary table is real.
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Marcel?
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Hi! Wish me luck!
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
Oh? Hello you.
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
Hey.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
No you didn't!
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Eww!
But I already gave them back to you!
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
My guy has great teeth!
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
I do too.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Right.
Excuse me, is this your car?
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
We want the last six years back!!
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
I thought you meant in life.
Yes!! Ohh.
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
Oh. Oh.
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
So?
Hey!
Getting so good at that!
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
No, just a barrel.
Yeah!
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Rach?
I'm talking about massages.
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!

Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
I do!
Why not?
I hope it's you.
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
No Rachel! They got here first!
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
No! You should've read it yourself!
Hey! Oh!
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
So, you're like a zillionaire?
Ross says hi.
How come?
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
