Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Well, where was I?
You're smart. I like that.
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Great! Roomie!
Oh, you weren't finished?
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
