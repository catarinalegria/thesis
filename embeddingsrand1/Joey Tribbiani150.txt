Open the box!!
Hey guys.
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
I'll never get to be a best man!
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Yes!
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Ohh, I know one thing!
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Hey Phoebs.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Ohh, I love birds.
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Hey.
Okay.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
All right.
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
What the hell is that?!!
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
Later!
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Someone like an...angel?
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
Nice shoes, huh?
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Good night.
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
No.
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
You meant sex, right?
So?
But it's dark out.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Oh, okay. The what?
I'm him.
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
No-no.
Monkey lover!
Then you go to Tokyo.
Hey!
Such as?
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
He's fine!
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Oh yeah, that's right!
Joey.
You look good.
Good luck Phoebs.
Is ah, is Chandler around?
Well, back to square one.
Thanks.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
A little salami.
Maybe he's. . . gay.
I finished my book.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Yeah! Me too.
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
You won't boss me around anymore?
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
Pheebs, run!
Hey!
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Do we have to know about that?
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
What a phony.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Right this is staging.
No.
Somebody help me out here!
Yes!!
Wow, it's really long.
All right Phoebs, way to go.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Ohh yeah.
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
What a bad idea!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
The vicar!
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Oh. What do you do?
No way! It's mine!!
I'm comin' out!
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
No, never done that either.
We have a half hour.
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
They're gonna do it together.
Okay!
You got porn!
Yeah!
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Oh, I know...
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
