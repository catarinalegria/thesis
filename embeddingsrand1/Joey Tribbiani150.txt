No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
She's right in there.
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
A little foos?
You and Rachel.
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
If I can't have it you can't have it!
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Well, how-how come?
Mornin' Pheebs!
Okay.
Hey!
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
What?
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Ma! What're you doing here?
Come on, I need your help here.
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
Ugh!!
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Feminine.
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Ohhh.
Glass of fat?
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
All right, Ross!
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Ooh!
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Okay, Phoebe...
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Yeah, well...
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Home is Home Star stew.
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
The ring is gone!
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
Miracle!
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
That's right!
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Pretty much, yeah.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Hey.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Don't answer that.
Yep.
Huh.
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
We don't make enough fun of you already?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
You?! And-and you?!
I know! Neither did I!
Yeah! That guy's all right!
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Don't come out here!
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Sh-shh-shh!
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Whatever.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Yeah, what' going on?
Well he made Rachel cry!
You spit on me man!
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
Uhh, Monica?
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
....Are we still talking about sex?
Ooh, I like that.
Baywatch.
Then you're not invited.
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
Big fat goalie.
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
That's a good call. Right.
I don't know! Charity?
All right!
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
Ah.
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
You seen Sandy?
I can't tell you what I know.
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Dad, Ronni's here.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
This body?
Transplant.
Mine!
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
I don't feel like talkin.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
I know.
Hey!
Why would you want to do that?
Yeah baby!
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Sounds nice.
Hey.
What?! Tonight?!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
How do you mean?
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Yeah.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Yeah!
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Ooh, I look good.
Never had that dream.
