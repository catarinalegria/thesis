Hello Tilly.
Ok, yeah.
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
All those things I said about not being ready...
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
Oh, hi Rachel.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
This does.
And the spitting?
I can't do that.
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Phoebe...
You are so adorable.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
It was you?
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Joanna passed away last night.
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Hey guys! Hey!
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
Oy!
Ooohhh.
What about my friend Victor?
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
How you doin there squirmy?
Plate. Plate. Plate.
No, it was. It was very very good.
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
What?! I've never seen one before!
Okay!
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
What's not funny?
Behind you?
What's you point man?
Oh Rachel, uhh...
Monica! Chandler!
Me too.
So.
Yeah.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Hi Joey.
I don't know, it's just...
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm in love with you.
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Oh, me too.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
You obviously can't keep away from her.
What is wrong now?!
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
What, you don't think I know that?
Why?
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
Hey!
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
Yeah?
Become a drama critic!
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
Yeah, it sure does.
Good to see you too!
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
He told on us?
Anytime you're ready.
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Yeah.
He touched my fanny.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
A lesbian?
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
What are you doing here?
We will.
Yeah-yeah.
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
Really?
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Chandler.
Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
Honey, it isn't good luck.
Okay. I'll miss you.
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
Nooo!!
We agreed on Minnie.
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
You're a genius, Ross.
Oh, ohhhhh.
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
No, I think it's cute.
Let's go!!
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Oh yeah. See you guys.
Doorknob?
Good morning!
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
Yuh.
Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Oh! Yeah!
Ah here, we brought wine.
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
Hi! Hey!
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Ross!
Hey!
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
That's not true?
Well ah, what can you swing?
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
No-no-no, the kiss was good.
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
Yeah.
I love you sweetheart.
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Roll-roll!!
You look very pretty today.
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
July. Umm,
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Do you?
Pete?!
Oh please God, let there be a song.
Well....
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Hello.
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
Knick fan?
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Ohh. Like what?
Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
How can I help you?
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
I'm Dutch.
No, but I can't-
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Well all right, one thing happened?
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
I don't know.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Yeah?
He says he was too.
Hey.
Okay.
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
So, this was uh, really fun.
Um, would you like to come in?
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
I think it was valued at 19,000
No way!
Oh, jeez.
I'm OK
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Ohhh.
Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Oh, Jack.
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
And tell him what?
I'm afraid so.
Went out with Joey.
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
N-No running in the chapel!
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
Um, thank you for the gift.
Daddy!!
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
Out!
Yeah!
Uhh, you said there was a party.
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
Yeah.
I love both of you!
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
I forgot my purse.
He started it!
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
A moustache comb.
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Look I want you, now.
As much as he needs.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
See.
Call me.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
Wow! What an unusual cat!
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Okay, now I've really have to go!
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
Alright.
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
Uh sure.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Guess who?
No.
We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
Nora!
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
What?
You're good. You're good!
You, get out of my shop!
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Five dollars a box.
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Give me the dice.
Oh. Thanks.
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Oh my God!
Professor Geller!
Bye.
What's my last name?
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
No! Why does he have to go?
Damnit!
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
What about it?
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Hey.
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
Hi, Phoe.
Your son.
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
Pizza guy!
He told me in person.
What is it?
So gross!
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
Why not?
Mon-Monica?
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Hello everybody!
I came to give you this and this.
Joey, right?
All right. I'll get my bag.
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
Am I too late?!
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Santa's mad at me.
No.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
There is a little child inside this man!
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
Oh, hi.
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
Amy!
Susan and I live together.
Oh no.
Keep on scooching.
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Like this.
Well.
No.
I want you right here, right now.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
I'll even let you ring the bell.
What did you say?!
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Rachel?
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
I hear you can get people out of here.
Wow!
Hey!
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Thanks, any suggestions?
Each.
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Yeah.
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
Oh, I never could do it.
We're back on.
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Um-hmm.
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
How ya doin'?
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
Bye.
What do you mean, your seat?
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Hi, its us.
I didn't read it.
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Okay.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Yes, at 4:00.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Hi!
How would you like to pay?
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
Rachel.
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Yeah.
You did a good thing today.
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Y!
It's not here.
Oh, you know what?
No, I'm not.
Screw it! I'm having one.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
Can I do it to you?
Let's go Phoebe!
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
"You have two new messages."
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
Cantaloupe juice.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Really?
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
How are you?
Plate?
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
$4.50 please.
No! They did!
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
Okay.
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
Thank you sweetheart.
Ohhhh.
Yeah!
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
What?!
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
That's okay.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Just those two!
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
Why are you yelling?
Okay, I love you.
Hey Pete.
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
You're strict.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oooooo....
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke.
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Hey, Ben! Hey!
Done!
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
What?
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Good-bye.
Shes still here.
Hey Joey!
Hi.
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
So I understand you're looking for a place.
Is there something wrong?
I'll be in in a minute.
Your turn.
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
That's about 60 cents.
Hi!
You want some?!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
Hey!
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
I'm the student.
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
The Celtics.
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
But, you left the chair area.
It's this way? Sorry.
Who's out there?
This?
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
She took all my stuff.
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, maybe that's it.
Ready to go?
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
You were amazing out there.
Dude!
My fish, Buddy.
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
What?!
Thank you so much for coming.
Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Woah.
Yeah, we are.
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Hey there Ross!
I don't know.
Who's doing shots?
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Thomas, come back here!
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Hey. Hi Phoebe.
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Ross, you remember Susan.
Um, leave.
Give me a 'for instance'.
M!
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
You okay, kiddo?
Can't wait.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
I'm so happy that you're here.
I don't think so.
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
What?! Anything! Anything!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
You are so bad!
Sure.
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Oww!!
Rachel?
Awww.
Hi Chandler!
Got it!
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Well I'm sorry.
Sorry!
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
Hi.
Ohhhhh!
Uh-huh.
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Yeah. Oh.
No, no, they only said you.
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
No that's not true. That is not true.
Well of course not, but you were very good.
Pizza!
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
Hey!
Come on in.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
No, I'm picking you up.
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
What's he talking about?
No!
Hey.
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
Hello, Rachel.
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
Yeah, well..
Yeah!
I'll do it.
It is Judy.
Oh?
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
This is from the woman at the bar.
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
It was.
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
I'm a dancer.
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
He went out for groceries.
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
Oh.
Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Working with blind kids.
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
Nope.
What?
Wow, you have really pretty feet.
I love that idea!
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
What're you doing? Are you scratching?
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Yes. They're insanely white.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Sure.
All right.
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
Hey! Sugar-O's!
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Maybe.
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
He went out with my wife!
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
It's me, Carl.
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
No no no! Federal regulations!
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
You have pets!
I could have cats.
You are playing American football?
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Hi.
No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
Yeah, I was just kidding.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
Ew, this feels very weird.
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Oh please, a relationship.
No, I wanna melt it.
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
Your messages have been erased.
Hi.
Thanks a million.
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
8!:
Because we can remember them.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Who are you?!
Hi!
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Need uh, need a little hand there.
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
Right.
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
We're on in 3, 2,
No, let me explain! Fired!!
I hate actors.
Don't be too long.
Count faster.
That's because they are.
I-I-I don't think so.
We have our babies?
Y'know what? We need to move on.
Hey!
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
No, I'm still married.
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Ow!!
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Hi!
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
Yeah, refrigerator college.
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
C'mon kid, let's go.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Yeah...
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
Hey!
Looks good. I'll take it.
Hey!
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Bye.
Oh, sorry.
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Lose the robe.
Wh..
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
So how did you know I was even here?
Oh, god.
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
This is really hard for me to say.
C'MON!
Oh my God!!
Yeah. Hate him.
All right.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Whoa!!
Yeah, big fan.
The receipt.
No.
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
With a K.
You wanna touch it?
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Can I see your license please?
So how did everything go?
Excuse me?
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
And there is Kevin.
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
She's there?!
Good luck, babe.
Hey.
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
He's kind of intense huh?
Life partner.
No. I'm all alone.
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Normally, I would not do it.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Yes...
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Oh! God! Wow!
What?
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
Sorry, prom queen.
What people?
What are you doing?
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
And who may I say is calling?
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
That's right.
Really, y'think so? I don't..
Rachel.
Oh God.
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Huh?!
Surprise.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
What are you doing here?
When?
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Umm...
That you and daddy were not on a break.
Okay.
No!
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Yay!
Two.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
Yeah.
C'mon.
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Please, can't you help me out?
It's Erica.
Come on in.
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
That's okay.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Yeah, they're not so bad.
Hey Rachel!
I have to get back to...
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
Oh God help me.
That's kinda sad.
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
I am gonna try and quit drinking.
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Hey, where's the chicken?
Horrible!
I wasn't ready for it.
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
No, I was working on my pottery.
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
Ohh, so cute.
Hey.
It's a curling iron.
Any luck?
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.

I know. That's what I told her.
Joey!

Hey!
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Who are you?
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Well, you kids take the train in?
Alright, let's take this outside.
Thank you so much.
Hi.
Oh yeah!
Hey! What's going on?
No I didn't.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch...
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Morning!
Hey!
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!
You're welcome.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
Yeah.
Alright!
Certainly.
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Nice to meet you Mac!
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Monica bang!
Really? You'll do anything?
I don't think I should say.
Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
...Yes?
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
Mr. Tribbiani.
On your back... Mom.
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Okay!
All right.
Hi Kim.
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
I know!
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Hey.
Then don't break in!!
So you guys want coffees?
Hey.
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
That would work.
Were you this cute in high school?
But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother.
Ugh. Ross!
Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
No! It don't go up on the wall!
Let's show 'em.
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less...
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
One, two, three...
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
What can I say? She nailed it.
Yay!!
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
You don't wanna know.
Then, you're redoing it because...
Huh, I never really noticed.
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Stay.
Action!
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Ready?
No, you can't use your watch.
This one's from me.
Uhh-huh.
Its a little complicated.
Are you serious?
In the park?
Yeah, OK.
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
I say, punch him Joey.
Hi!
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
I can't imagine why.
No, let me finish.
Take care.
Your license?
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
The game is over, we eat now?
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
But like how?
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
Oh well, I'm divorced.
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
You're doing it again.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
So.
I knew it, wow!!
I'll go.
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
But, you're not identical twins.
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Oh yeah!
I'm a little embarrassed.
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Yeah!
And I do have one seat left.
Oh, like you don't already have everything.
Drops. Here, they're free.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
He painted that.
No, go ahead.
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Where do I know you from?
