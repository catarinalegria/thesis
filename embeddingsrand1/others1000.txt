Yeah!
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
Is all this true?
Stay.
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Just aim for the bump.
Hi.
Normal.
Oh really?
I'll be okay.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
You brought a carrot.
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Bye.
Thank you so much for coming.
Uhh...Shall I go on?
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
No.
...and live forever as a machine!
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
I was gonna say...
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
Wait! We need shoes!
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
That's kinda sad.
Nooo.
What?
Good idea! Yes!
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Noo!!
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Well, here's your phone doctor.
Ready?
Someone in there?
Breakfast is near!
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Okay.
A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
Oh honey, I'm fine.
So?
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Woo-hooooo!!!!
Daddy cut me off.
Whaddyou want?
Oh my God!!
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Si.
Show me in the table.
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Take thee Ross...
Sorry, what?
Hi, I'm Karen.
No, no, they only said you.
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Wow. He's strict.
Wow!
Who are you talking too?
Oh, my.
Ross, are you okay?
Ross!
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
Um, now. Phoebs.
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
Shhhh!
Well then we'll get wet.
You are!
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Um-hum, you're jealous.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
You're welcome.
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Okay.
I guess he doesn't know.
Hey, Pheebs.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
Absolutely, yeah!
Shut the book!
Oh great!
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
A tad.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Okay.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Um-hmm.
Bye Ross.
You are!
No.
Hombre?
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
No, she touched mine first!
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
You may kiss the bride.
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
What?
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
So? I mean have you thought about it?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
You wanted to see me?
No.
Yeah.
I'll take it all.
What about Benitez?
Your son.
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
See ya.
Guess who?
Hey!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
Damnit!
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
Charles.
Flexible hours.
Oh!
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
She's not a twinkie.
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Good luck, babe.
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
Okay!
Hey, what do you want to drink?
That's sweet. Could I take her?
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
Can I help you?
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Hi!
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Monica! Where are you from?
Chandler's a girl!
Stop it!
Woah!
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
You okay?
Yeah!
Okay.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
You are playing American football?
Hi! What are you doing here?
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
Okay. You ready to push again?
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Excuse me?
Look at that.
Alright.
Neither am I.
One more chance Ursula, please?
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
Uh-oh, busted!
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?

Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
Hi!
Yeah, what's the gala for?
Uh-huh, yeah.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
Oh, great! Me too.
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Hey!
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Oh, sorry.
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
No, I really did forget my purse.
Maybe in L.A?
Hi Ralph.
Hi, Phoe.
I think you may have a drinking problem.
You're in this picture?
Great!
Oh, you forgot?
It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Yeah, um, may we help you?
Yeah!
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
Can I please see your face?
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
Gotcha!!
That's right.
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
I'd love an ice water.
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
...Now? Now?
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
What happened to the library?
...Like, ...all of them?
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
Hi, how's it goin?
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
Hi honey.
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
Uh, may I help you?
For what?
What?
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
What're you doing?
Push, push!
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
Like this.
Great.
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
So... We go eat.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
We'll go to a hotel.
No way!
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
This will be your phone.
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
Oh.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Would you.......Would you hug me?
Allright!
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Y-, y-, you like that show?
So, who's the lucky guy?
I'm moving in.
Lebanon.
Someone in here.
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
Awww!
Aaaahhhhhhh.
No more pranks.
So, are you a member of any gym.
That's fine.
Hi!
Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
Yeah.
I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
Oh!
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
I'm talkin'!
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
No no no!
And for you sir?
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Yeah.
Good.
Hey.
Hey guys!
We're back on.
Monopoly!
Chandler is fantastic!!
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
What's up?
Yeah.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
So...
I love both of you!
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
My breast milk is gross?
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
One second.
What?!
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Why are your eyes so white?
It's raining men!
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
Yes, Papaya Extract.
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
Any progress?
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
Right! Okay.
I'll go.
Okay, I bought a boat.
I've had a really good time tonight.
Oh. Uh, what?
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
No you do. You... just...
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Any time you're ready, Joey.
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
All right.
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
Hi.
None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
That's a good one!
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Really?
I'm Gail.
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
Oh, okay.
Hello darlings.
Poco... a leetle.
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
We will.
Ohh!
I own this store.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Hey!
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Dear?
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry?
Three babies?
I really can't slap you.
Really?
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Hey, Rach!
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
Whoa! Ohh!!
Yeah, is she really 20.
What?
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Uh sure.
Don't spoil it.
I'm ready!
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Which guy?
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
N-No running in the chapel!
Yes.
No! Why?
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Hey Monica, it's Chip.
Great.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Yes.
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
But they're not here yet!
That's Hanson.
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
What?
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
No, it's really good.
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
What are you doing here?
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
Yeah.
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
Are those your teeth??
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
No.
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Just relax. Just relax Paul, you're doing great. She likes you. She... Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y'know why? Because you're a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. I'm just a love machine and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! Showtime. I'm just a love machine, yeah ba-by!
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
How are ya man?
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
C'mere, Patti.
So what did you do today?
Monica, Monica is great.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
Oh, I love you too. But...
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
Hey.
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Noo! NO!
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
The one in the director's chair.
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Oops.
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
It's me, Carl.
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
What?! I've never seen one before!
What?!
Ahh.
Hey baby, I'm back...
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Yeah.
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
God bless the chickpea.
I wish I didn't have to go.
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
I can't help you Joey.
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
Oh, no thanks.
Are you serious?

You are!
...No, we hate him.
So.
Mon!
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Hey.
Very bad!
Still no luck.
The other us.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
Hmm, noodle soup.
Yesss?
I'm the student.
You two were married?!
Hey, what do you want to drink?
I think I need a drink.
Yay!!
I knew you'd understand.
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
You stop!
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Ready, Annabelle?
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
What?!
I can do that.
What about shut up?
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
Hi!
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Hi!
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
Chicken? Chicken boy!
Oh. Thanks.
You?
Hey.
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
Really? Then why are you like that?
Okay, anytime.
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
That might be fun.
What?
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
Wait, just a second.
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
All right.
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Ross.
We've got a problem.
Uhh, actually y'know what, I kinda-I have to take off.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
I can't!!
Oh, I totally agree.
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
Hey Pheebs!
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
Thank you.
Really?
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
Hi!!
Life partner.
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
What?! Anything! Anything!
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Rachel!
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Yeah, big fan.
What's going on over here?
What woman?!
Well all right, one thing happened?
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
And who may I say is calling?
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
You slept with another woman?
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
Hey!
The game is over, we eat now?
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
No.
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
All right.
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
Joey!
Well, thanks for the books.
You can have it!
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
Look, I. . .
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
M!
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
So, how are you doing?
Yeah. All right.
Happy birthday sweetie.
I know. That's what I told her.
Chandler.
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
Professor Geller?
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
Okay.
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
Yep.
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
We really do feel bad about this though.
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
It's perfect.
Oh, well, I'll show you around.
Why?!
Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
How are you?
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
How did you know there was a but?
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm...
Auntie Monica!!
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
It's lovely to meet you.
That's just the way it is.
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Oh, yeah!
Joey!
It's nice to have a boyfriend.
You obviously can't keep away from her.
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
You did a bad thing!
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Ciao, bela.
I want you to move in with me.
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Hi!
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
It is Judy.
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
One, two, three...
Well, this has been fun.
Oh!
Yes.
You're look for laughable...
Thanks for your help.
Chandler Bing?
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Here we go.
Oh, really?
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
Oh my God!
Hi Monica.
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
Lovely, just lovely.
I will flip you for it.
What is it?
It's open! Come in!
Oh no.
What contracts?
What are you doing?
On your back... Mom.
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
Who are you?
Hi!
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
I'm sorry, I do that.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Elizabeth!
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Alright, we'll share.
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Ah, you... have the sex?
Yep.
Yeah.
Miss? May I help you?
No.
Scene 5, take 2.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
Joey.
Not really.
I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
Good morning.
I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Is there something wrong?
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
Hey, you like pizza?
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Oh my God!
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
Joey!
You lost 13 million dollars.
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Hi. Hi.
Hey. I was...
Ok, yeah.
Thank you so much.
Oh Hans.
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
Hey!
What was all that about?
Oh, yeah!
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
It can do this.
Uh-huh.
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Where can I wash up?
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
You really didn't have to. Wow.
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Your license?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
Here he comes! Hurry!
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
Yeah.
You're strict.
Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Drink?
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
In the park?
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
Thing?
Just call me Paul.
You're into hardcore S&M right?
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
Any minute now.
Aaaaah!
I don't want you taking that thing.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Oh, me too.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
Yeah.
Oh.
Making out in your office.
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
I'm sorry.
No, but that's bad!
Thanks.
Ross!
Ohh!
Why not?
No! They did!
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
Okay.
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
What kinda noise?
Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
Good.
How did we do?
Howard's the handy man!
Geller!
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Yeah.
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
Sure. What?
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
-make the decision-
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
Yeah.
Bed?
Marlon-
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
You look very pretty today.
No, you don't.
Oh God help me.
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
Cut.
Phoebe?
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
No.
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Oh my God, I'm married!
Hey, Joey.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
You have a son?
Where?
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
I am gonna try and quit drinking.
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
I'm Tilly.
You need these books.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Yeah.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Well of course not, but you were very good.
Not.... helping!
How's it gonna be all right?!
Speech! Come on Monica!
Alright, I'll call you.
8,600.
That I was not expecting.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
Yeah, isn't he?
They're your backup singers... beind you.
Really! You-you sail?
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Are you gonna play?
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
Here you go.
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
I heard ya.
Where are we?
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
All right, fine.
Call me.
I'm sorry?
Well, sure, that too.
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
Ah, just one other thing.
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
I could have birds.
What's with this guy?
Just give me a chance too...
Um, I'm not.
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
Am I allowed to drink anything?
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
Well, my nose got lonely.
I'm not on the list!
Hi!
Almost time for cake.
My what?
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Yeah! Right!
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
All right.
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Oh no.
Why?
Who-who else is in vice up there?
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
Whoa! Big octopus.
It's Erica.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Yeah.
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."
You didn't!
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
I'll be there.
I'm OK
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Get my glasses too.
Hola, Joey!
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.

...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
Okay.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Did anybody call for security?
That won't be necessary.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
I'm Dutch.
Oh my God!!
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Okay.
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
Do you know who at my office?
Why are you so jealous of me?
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
Yes! Phoebe.
Come on, touch it!
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
So what do you want?
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Oh really?
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
France sucks!
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
You too.
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Hey!
Right, why do you keep saying that?
So, all right.
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
Hey, it's everybody.
No.
Thomas, come back here!
Really? I'm a hero.
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
Ok.
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Come on. I'll let you lead.
Well, we were...
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Oh-no.
