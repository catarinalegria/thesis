Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
It's okay to laugh right?
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
We could have breakfast in bed...
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Yeah?
Who is it?
What does she mean by HH?
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Definitely.
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
God, what happened?!
These old things.
Yeah, it's a vase.
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
You wanna work on your interview skills?
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Okay.
Yeah!
Come where?
Really?! Are you sure?
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Yeah!
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Really?
Oh no! Why?
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
Oh, okay.
I want to see what he wants first.
All right, that's it, I quit.
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
What's the matter?
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!

But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
No-no, let me in!
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
I, OK....
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Well, I think I can help you get over him.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Hey!
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Hey, why don't you?
Hey, Mon.
Hey.
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
What'd I say?
And a glass of tepid water.
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Oh, I can still do that.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Ooh! That's so nice...
Sorry Jill.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Fine.
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Does it look like a urinal?
Huh?
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
No.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
With?
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
I can't believe this!
Oh good, you're all up.
Hey!
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Oh, thank you.
Joey's!
Whattaya mean?
Watch this.
I don't even know how that would work!
You know her?!
It's Phoebe.
No, it's fate!
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
No Rachel! They got here first!
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
And because you're both, you know, white women.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Wait, you can't take the money out.
Tell him, tell him.
Hey! Hi!
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
Yeah.
I see.
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
Hi!
Really?! What's your name?
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
What do you mean?
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
A chin dimple!
Come on, take 'em off!!
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
Oh, they love your casserole.
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
The coins have finally forgiven me!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
Then do Iceberg!
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
It's your thing, and-
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Well, that could've been really awkward.
Yes! .... or no.
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
What?!
Yeah?
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
So?
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Okay!
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Oh yeah, so you know D?
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
What?
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Oh.
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
I'm sorry.
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Because I cared enough to lie!
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Oh yeah!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Hey!
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Rdtor.
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Yeah.
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
How do you know?
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Yeah!
Secret affair!
Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Oh. What's a lurker?
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
Why?
Now what is Fabutec?
Why?!
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
That was my dad!
Not that often!
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
You missed a belt loop.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
Where's Chandler?
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
North route or south route?
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Oh! Yeah!
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Oh.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Hi.
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Not yet, no.
Maybe it was the guy.
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
Bye you.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
No, whatever! Anything!
Oh, hey, you guys!
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Hi...
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
I'm just helping the kids!
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
What?!
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
So... and?
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Count for what?
Oh yeah, that's over.
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Oh, I see.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Hey!
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Hi!
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Already?!
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Go ahead.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
No, but let's come back to that later!
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
Hey, did she buy it?
Hey, and then lunch.
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Uh-huh.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Are you alright?
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Uh-huh, yeah that's right.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
I'm sorry.
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
No! Ooh! Oh my god!
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
I don't use a curling iron.
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Okay, who's next?
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
Oh my God!
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Hello?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
Give it.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Hey, Lizzie.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
Let's run towards them!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Okay!
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Ready?
Ross?!
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Why not?!
What?
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
I haven't really had any yet.
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Wh-what do we do?
Okay!
You never run on a barge!
Hey Rach!
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Oh, hi Ross!
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Woof, woof.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Oh, wow.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Oh!
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Jason?
Okay.
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
I-We gotta get Monica.
Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Hey!
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
I know.
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
The little ones do.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know...
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Nothing-Why?!
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Janice.
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
Yeah, welcome.
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
OK, is this really my father?
Do I?
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
And you're so sweet. And you're kind
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
What?
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Nu-uh!
What?
Hi!
Does it look like an ashtray?
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Hey cool, mine too.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Hey!!
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
John?
Tell him it's for you.
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Stop it!
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Hey! Oh!
Well, I am.
Okay.
Dumbass!
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
Garfunkle.
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Oh.
Rach, you're in my seat.
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Sex in his chair.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Paolo made a pass at me.
Oh, you're such a cheater!
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Oh, like that's a word.
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Oh? Hello you.
You've never asked a guy out?!!
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
I am shocked! Shocked!!
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Really?
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Does Joey know?
Who the hell are all these people?
You're Frank Buffay?
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
No! It's nice!
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
How come?
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Oh, me too!
Hey!
Oh! You got it?!
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Yeah, yeah!
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?

Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.

Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Yeah?
Well, then...Let's.
I know. They were mine.
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Oh!
Ohh. What is this?
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
I think she would like that.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Hi Paul!
Well, if you think it will help.
Yeah!
Thanks.
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Central... Park!
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Hey!
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Hey you guys! Look!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
What were you doing?
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
So talk to her.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
Hey!
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Oh.
Okay!
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Oh no.
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
She is so great! I miss her.
Hello.
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
No thanks, I've already seen one.
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
Why do you care?
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
And we did.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Ohhhh.
Ooh, erotiery!
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
But at least the apothecary table is real.
Bye, fat ass.
Well, he made a move on me.
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
Oh, right!
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Can I tell you a little secret?
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
What are you gonna do?
Stick a fork what?
Okay, um, stay.
Yeah! What are you saying?
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
What happened?
Fun Bobby is so great.
Fine! Be murky!
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Yeah?
The little jail between the doors!
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
What? Oh my God!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Me too. Rachel.
Hey!
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
Hey.
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
Eww!
Sure.
Please, I think you know why.
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
So when, when do you leave?
What else do they add smell too?
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
What is that sparkly thing?
Yeah.
Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
No.
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Yeah?
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Well, are any of those people here?!
OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Hey.
Ooh, I like cards.
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
He just got a divorce right?
Ohh!
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
What's goin' on?
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Thanks!
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Sure
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Sing!!
You mean like a doctor?
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
Uh-hmm.
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Okay, your highness.
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Since when are you into swing music?
: Your Visa bill is huge!
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Yes! Your honor?
What?
Oh, Chandler funny?
Yeah!
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
Of course, yeah!
...Then I've already seen this one!
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
Ross, please! My make-up!
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
...like a...
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Okay. Hey Rach?
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Yeah? Hi!
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Oh, what? What was it?
I know, it is.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
What happened?
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Oh, yay!
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
What is it?
and...
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Yeah, okay, my bad.
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
You mean a backup?
Okay, it's okay.
Dance karate?
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
I thought you knew that.
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Really?!
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
No that made me feel precious.
I'm in.
Such a pig!
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Like what?
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Is he alright?
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Should I not have told you?
Get in here!!!
What?
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Okay.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Hey.
I am soo dead.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Thanks.
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Bye.
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
She is gonna hate me.
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Wash your hands!!!
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
I'll be waiting.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Hey Rach.
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
I'm having my first contraction!
Okay.
Thank you!
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
That play?
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
What?! That's the first time today!
Really?! How come?
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
We're all right.
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Thank you! I know, though.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
What do you know?!
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Hm-mmm.
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
I don't want to hear about her!!
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
I think on my shoulder.
Hey!
Hey!
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Hey!
What's in the bag?
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Great! Okay, good for you!
Chandler?
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Ooh, God it looks bad.
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
That's too much. Sorry.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Joey!
Guys, I'm happy too.
That would be great. Thank you.
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Sure!
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
That's him.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
Yeah, why not?
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
She wants to meet you in person.
And then... your face is bloated?
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Pat Sajak?
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
What?!
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Well, what did he do?
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Oh.
God!
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
But you guys came so close.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Least of all you.
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Oh. Oh.
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
No, why?
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Umm, a flea market?
Okay. No. But thanks.
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Alrighty, here come the water works.
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Are you gonna go over there?
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
Nope.
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
Thanks!
So now what's going on here?
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Okay.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Oh. Hey!
Ross, where did you get this?!
How did that happen?!!
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
No, but he's always late.
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
All right.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
There you go.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Ahh, his work is done.
Thank you.
Hey.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Thank God.
I found it!
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
What?
I know! Robin is so gay!
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Oh.
Well, he stabbed me first!!
You guys are here! Yay!
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
Oh! Oh my God!
You tired Chandler?
Which one?
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
I'm done now.
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Does Joey have any idea?
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Does he know?
What?!
Hey! Look who I found!
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
Nooo!!
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Hey!
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
So, did you pick one yet?
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Okay, bye!
Okey-doke.
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
G'night, bro.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Nice!
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Hey!
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Uh... yay!
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
Sure!
It's Ross.
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.

Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Yeah.
It's not that bad.
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
I got no sleep last night!
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
Hey! I call her!
Why, nobody good?
You! An actor?! That's madness!
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
Hmm, bummer.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
How can you not know which one?
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Hi.
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Nope, not knocked up yet.
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
So, what should you have done?
They've been quiet for a long time.
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
Well, this is none of my business.
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Yeah absolutely!
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
That's too hard. Too hard!
Hey!
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Would she?
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Yeah.
That chick can't handle my corner.
Yay me.
I'll have coffee.
What, that's it?
Shhhh!
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Interesting.
Drum roll.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
So. You two are totally into each other.
Really?!
Hey.
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
YOU KNOW?!!!
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Cool.
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
God, Susan is so fun!
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
I got it! Mine!
London is stupid! Stupid!
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Lilly's dead.
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
Hi!
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Oh!
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
And why not?!
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Me too.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
So that story doesn't make you cry?
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
OK.
Which proves that I never lie.
Hey!
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
You told me.
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
What?
Saved your ass.
What, he's 18.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Not for you.
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
This is Patrick.
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
And, and!
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
What?
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
Better. Yeah.
Hey! Ross!
Chandler?
Okay, listen Robert...
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
where were you standing?
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Okay.
Uh-huh, what?
This is so great.
I know, I'm so excited!
Hi Emily!
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
I think it went into me.
What is your job?
On a totally different bet.
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Yeah, I've been around.
Oh, hey!
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
Oh! You have a window!
I'll get it.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
You'll have a last kiss.
You just said...
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Okay, London 1...
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Oh.
Hey!
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Fine. All right, fine.
No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Okay.
This is Patrick.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Not a good day for birds...
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
Yeah well, we'll see.
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Really?
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Ahh.
Ross?
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
I think maybe, yeah.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
Ross says hi.
All right, you know Paolo?
Yes. Not out loud.
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Yeah?
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Okay. I'm going with you.
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
I, I, I'm hideous.
Ohh, impressive.
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
What was that?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Fired! Why?
Whatcha doin'?
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Oh.
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
He broke that.
What are we going to do?!
What is that?
Oh yeah.
I miss Rose.
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
We were out of Doritos.
Oh.
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
Yeah.
...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
No, 'cause he's yummy.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Oh.
Oh good.
Monica had lunch with Richard.
Okay everyone, think thick.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Oh, then no.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
No, you have to let me in right now!!
Hi!
I don't have it!
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Duly noted.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
and...
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Our mom.
I'm not asking!
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Hey!
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Ok, all right.
Why? What happened now?
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
Yeah. So?
Have you really done this before?
Yeah, yeah I got that.
Hey!
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
Oh, thanks!
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
What is that?
Here we go.
That is a different phone.
Swear?!
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Yes!
How did you do that?
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
Oh.
Rachel said that!
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
Good. So what were you thinking?
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Gunther, kiss me.
Open it up, let me see.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Ohh, yes it would.
We're all right.
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
Go for it.
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Wow, it was so-wow!
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
Oh, my, oh!
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
So is it like art?
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Yeah. Sorry.
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
Don't interrupt me!!
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
So how was, how was your date?
No.
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Always.
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
I know.
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Monica, leave him alone!
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
Yeah, no, it was great.
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Hey!
They're gonna call her Chandler.
Okay.
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Where are you going?
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.

Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Or, or the rodeo!!
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Everything?
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
Radiator.
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
I know.
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
What?!
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
I can do that for the kids.
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
It is your office.
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
All right, get a room.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
No! Coins hate me!
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Are you crazy?
Ugh, what's right with them?
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
Um, cake.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Hey.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Well, it's better than us deciding.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Hey!
Yes, but there isn't always time!
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Works on you.
17 years ago.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
I would love that job!
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
What were you thinking?
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
No.
With what?
Hey.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Oh, the Olympics.
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
On the touchy.
Oh me too.
Ooh, it's not bad.
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
What is this?
Ooh.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
All right, Joey, same question.
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
Which one do you have?
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
You guys, he's beautiful!
Yeah.
Ewww!!!
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Yeah!
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
You're not going?
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
Wow! I would trade.
Yeah, you too.
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Marcia and Chester.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Oops!
Oh, no.
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Ooh, who's it for?
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Oh.
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
All right, you go.
Hey!
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
But I like it here!
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Stay.
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Are you sure?
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
What?
Oh my God!
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
So uh, now look at the picture...
Ooh!
Enh. Sure!
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
That's great. Good for you guys.
Ooh! I found it!
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
Did he mention us?
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Maybe on some level.
Hey! What are you doing here?
What is this? What's going on?
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
I'm sorry.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
No, I want this to happen.
That's what you think.
Isn't he good?
Marcel?
That you don't stop talking about it.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
What am I sitting on?
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
OK, well then what is this?
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
You don't like ice cream?
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Hey!
Okay sure!
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Yeah!
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Why?
Watching ballroom dancing?
The end.
Come on! Look where you are!!
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Uh-huh, yeah!
Gary.
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
About what?
Floopy?
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
Oh good!
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Well, what period is it from?
That's what I said.
Well at least we know she's a woman.
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Wow!
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
Hi.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Oh well y'know.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Yeah?
He shot a bird!
Oh, hi.
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Good! Great! You can go first.
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Hey!
Okay.
Hey, you're early.
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Okay.
This is Monica.
Oh, you're not a dingus.
Really?!
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
And this is Rachel.
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
Yeah, we went shopping!
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
I hope it's you.
Hey!
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Rachel.
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Oh yeah, like you never called!
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
Why?
Oh he knows! For the most part.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Whoa! I kinda liked it.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Yeah!
Oh.
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Oh, that's great!!
Is it a meatball sub?
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Oh, yeah!
Everything you've heard is true.
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Give it!
Oh, I know.
Uh-huh. Good luck.
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
Ugh, PBS!
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Hey!
Or not, whatever.
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Hi.
Hm?
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Okay. Bye!
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Well, do you see any babies?
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
What?!
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Oh my God, I didn't...
Thank you.
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
God Joey, this is taking forever!
Well, actually it's just from me.
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Okay.
Hey.
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Okay.
Neither.
Ooh.
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
Oh-my-God!
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Oh that's right!
Yeah, kinda.
Huh?
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Hi!
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Hi Rob Dohnen.
Now, have you told anyone else?
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Whoo-hoo!
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Hey, how'd it go?
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Thanks! Okay.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Say what?
Hey.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
No.
I could've been killed I hope you know!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
I know!
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Ohhh.
Oh God!
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Okay.
What?!
Who's Barney.
That oughta do it.
Ooohh, why?
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Oh hey! How was your audition?
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
Apology accepted.
Yeah me too.
Ben, dinner!
Aren't you gonna go?
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Sorry.
Oh, let me see!
Oh, yeah. What's this?
I'm sorry.
No.
I'm still on "no."
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
So you're not homesick yet?
Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Susan, he looks just like you.
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Yeah.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
You got me.
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
See, he's her lobster.
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Why? Why do I have to learn?
How many beeps?
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Two?
Sorry.
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
It could be like a big giant guy.
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Ooh! Brian's Song!
Yes, good! Ok...
Yep!
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Have you seen your guy's body?
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Oh, we killed them all.
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
That might work!
Hey!
Yes!!! Oh!!
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Nah-ha!
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Sur-surprise.
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Big Bird's friend.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Oh.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
Uh-huh!
Oh.
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Sure.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Hey.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
Yeah, this has happened before.
I, but you're so close! No!
He could be in disguise, y'know.
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Joey.
Bye!
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Hey!
Thank you.
Oh.
What did you do on yours?
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
You can't have sex with her!
Come on, like you never talk that.
Do you like car games?
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
Okay.
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Yeah!
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Hey.
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
Yeah.
Rachel has a new doll.
Just for a second.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Hi, Ursula.
Show me the badge again.
Hey.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
No!
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
You were supposed to tell her!
Thank y...
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Hi.
Oh yeah, come here.
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
I don't get it.
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
You ate meat! You had sex!
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
I can't!!
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
All right, I can't wait!
No, but you're questioning my method!
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Yeah, totally.
All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Well, he didn't tell me.
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Hey.
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
Did you find the dress?
Why?
Well, maybe 25-26.
What?!
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Just get your nails done?
No, but you can't.
So nothing got ruined?
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
But...
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Okay whatever.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Still.
You're right.
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Hey!
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
