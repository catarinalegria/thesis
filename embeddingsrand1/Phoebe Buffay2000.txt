Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
What's going on?
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Yeah, coffeehouse.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
No!
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
What?
Oh yeah!
Hi!
The name was my favourite part!
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
You never run on a barge!
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
Hey.
Do you like car games?
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Hey, how'd it go?
Sure!
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
Yeah me too.
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Okay.
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
Sure.
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Nope.
Paolo made a pass at me.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Hey!!
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
Ooh.
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
There you go!
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Oh! Yeah!
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Oh no! Why?
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Hello? Hey Joey!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Okay.
Oh, I have cards!
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Really?
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Well then I think that's it.
Oh, yeah!
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
You're still gonna go out with her?!
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
Ha. Ha, ha.
All right. Good luck.
I would love that job!
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Are you still mad at us?
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
OK.
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
OK, let's go.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
My God, Joey!
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Will you get us better gifts?
Oh, ok bye-bye.
I do!
No, whatever! Anything!
Oh.
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
Here.
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Thanks! So are you.
Thank you.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Hey!
What are you talking about?!
Yummy noises.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
She wasn't a hooker.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
And-and you're using my name!
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
Yeah, all right.
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Thank God.
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
You're Frank's best man?!
No! Ooh! Oh my god!
No! I do want to!
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Fun Bobby is so great.
I think she's OK.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Hey!
Yeah?
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
I can hop.
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
Hi.
Surprise! Look who's back!
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Nice try.
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
So, um, have you told your parents?
No-no! I-I...I found one.
Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Sir! No sir!
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
You guys are here! Yay!
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
Where are you going?
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Yeah, but not just that.
You're there!
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
Chandler.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Well, are any of those people here?!
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Lusts of the flesh.
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Uh-huh, yeah!
Oh yeah?
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Marcel?
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
But why does it even matter?!
Is it a meatball sub?
You two will have very hairy children.
Hey.
I don't ever want to see you again!
Oh! No problem! I...
Huh?
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
I could've been killed I hope you know!
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Oh, wow.
Me too.
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Why do you care?
Hey.
I don't want to hear about her!!
You know her?!
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
They've been quiet for a long time.
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
'Cause that's just your taste.
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Still.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Happy birthday!
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Hey!
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
Yeah.
You guys!! Come on!
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
Why not?!
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Yeah, totally.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Ewwww!!
Hey!
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Hello.
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Thanks!
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
What?
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
I know.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
I know.
I did, but that was really fun.
Oh Ross, hi.
So?
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
No, don't look directly at them!
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Ow! Ow!
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Plate! Yes, plate.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Okay.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Wh-what do we do?
That's a bird!
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Sure.
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
No, I can spot you from here.
Uh, here. What time?
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
We thought you knew!
That might work!
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Ah!
Nothing! This is not over!
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
I wanna hear "The Sound."
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
I am.
Seriously, what-what's the part?
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
What happened?
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
What was that?
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Oh my God!
Do you have my birth certificate?
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
Hey.
Well, you know that psychic I see?
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
You completely stole my answer!
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Okay whatever.
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Sure.
No Rachel! They got here first!
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
But.
Yeah?
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Yeah, I understand.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
What are we going to do?!
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Naked alone time.
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Watch, watch.
Pat Sajak?
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
I know where Minsk is.
Oh.
Good. So what were you thinking?
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
What happened?
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
Oh, okay.
And a glass of tepid water.
That is a different phone.
Oh thank you.
All right, so, okay...
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Ewww!!!
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Oh.
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
We will give you $10.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Hey!
Which proves that I never lie.
Yeah, that'd be ok.
Oh my God!
Okay!
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
Or, or the rodeo!!
She seems fine now.
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Wh-wh-what are you doing?
Doing it on this table.
We're all right.
What were you doing?
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Alright, I can get you out.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
What's the matter?
Oh, I couldn't go in.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
They were threefold.
Hey!
She was?
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Uh-huh.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
What?!
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Nooo! Why would you think that?
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
Oh hey!
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
If!
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Here.
Ok, I'm in the book.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Marcia and Chester.
No.
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
You cook naked?
Oh good!
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we are.
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Oh my God! That's David!
Aren't you gonna go?
Hey.
No-no, let me in!
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Okay.
There you go.
A little bit, yeah.
Ooh! Oh!
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Oh, thank you.
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Y'know what that means?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
So, do you have any other possibilities?
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Yeah, you wish!
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Oh, this guy again.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
I guess so.
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
Ohh! No.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Thanks you guys! Again.
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Are you serious?!
So... and?
Well, actually it's just from me.
Your nails.
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Ohh, get a room.
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Yeah!
Ross?
Hey!
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
They're gonna call her Chandler.
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
Rachel?
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Chuck Woolery?
Lotsa things.
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Jason?
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
Hey!
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
You said I was boring--Ohh!
Oh! You got it?!
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
What makes it pilgrim?
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
It's not that bad.
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
No.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
No. But thanks.
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Okay, listen Robert...
Wait here. Breathe.
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Well, then...Let's.
Really?
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Umm, cups.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
You have chalk on your face.
It worked!
Yeah.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Come in.
Now, have you told anyone else?
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Yeah, maybe.
please...
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
Six months.
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
You'd already broken up.
Well, yeah.
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
Shiny.
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
I'm sorry.
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Oh, just look at her...
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
This is so great.
I have quarters!
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Oh my God! Is that him?
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Hey!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Yes, good! Ok...
Yeah!
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
What? What?
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
What?!
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
What are you wrapping?
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
I'm having a really good time!
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
I'm pretty.
Uh uh.
Hey.
Bye!!!
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Yes!! Ohh.
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Minsk?
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
What are you doing?
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
What?
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Okay.
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
No, Joey.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Hi Monica!
No, answer his.
Okay.
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Joey!
Bye you.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Ohh.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
No, nothing.
Okay.
You mean like a doctor?
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Yes, you're having a boy!
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Do it!
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Maybe there's someone else.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Uh... yay!
Oh, I'll get it.
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
Fauna.
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
My guy is well read.
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Ooh!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
Just for a second.
Oh, then no.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Hey!
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
That is funny.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
Hey.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
Oh, is the play over?
That oughta do it.
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Ross?
Yeah?
Ooh! Hi!
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Then do Iceberg!
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Hi Rob Dohnen.
It starts?
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
where were you standing?
Then keep running.
Thanks Monica!
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Hi!
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Hey!
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
He broke that.
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
Yay, I rock.
Nah. I kept myself busy.
Oh-my-God!
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
Hi!
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
All right all ready.
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
You work with robots!!
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Nah. Not really.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
What?
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Joey's!
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Whe-where did he put it?!
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
What? Oh my God!
OK.
Works on you.
Ooh! I found it!
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
Hi, you guys.
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Oh good.
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Yeah. See?
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Yeah!
Say what?
And who else is going to be there?
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
Chandler what are you doing?!
Okay, I'm hearing.
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Oh no.
Hey.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
What about my cab?
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Hey!
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Well, just buy the damn boat!
My guy has great teeth!
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
There's no dog in here.
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
Yeah that's better than my way.
Secret affair!
What surprise party?
So was it a lot more money?
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Yeah, totally!
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Me too! So happy for them!
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
Stay.
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Oh my God.
Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
Wait a minute. What's his name?
About what?
Oh.
It could be like a big giant guy.
Gunther, kiss me.
Uma Thurman.
Oh, me too!
Okay, let's go running!
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
Oh, all right. What did I have?
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
Well that's great! Congratulations!!
We want the last six years back!!
Okay.
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Hey Ryan, what's up?
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Sure.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Not yet, no.
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Well, I am.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Tell him it's for you.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Goodnight.
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
G'night, bro.
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
I know.
So what are they doing?
There he is!
Yeah
Hey.
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
One of the babies is kicking.
'My scones.'
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Hey!
Yeah!
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Hi, so what happened?
Gum!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Joey.
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Yes, I will tell her.
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
So when, when do you leave?
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
No, I think you should tell them.
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Oh my God!!
Ahh, his work is done.
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
Which time?
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
Sure
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Oh, hi.
Ok, do you know A minor?
It's okay to laugh right?
I know what time you said.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Ross says hi.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Okay, you wore me down.
What?
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Jason is not a sissy!
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
I don't even know how that would work!
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
All right, so let's switch.
It's James Bond.
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Helloo! Oh!
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Because I think it means more to you.
Oh, like that's a word.
You missed a belt loop.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
How much was it?
I am extremely talented!
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
I'll give you $1 for them.
That won't go with this dress though.
Yeah, come to papa.
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Huh?
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Kills you?
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
What?
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
North route or south route?
What?! What the hell?!
Oh, let me see!
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
What is this?
Finger sandwiches and tea.
Yeah!
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Yeah, yeah!
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Ohhh!!!
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Interesting.
Uh-huh!
Big Bird's friend.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Okay.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Hey!
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Yeah?
Hey.
Nooo!!
Yeah? Hi!
What?
Yeah, he's gotta go.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Hey.
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Okay.
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
But I like it here!
Hey! Look who I found!
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Oh. Uh, I'm on.
Yeah, kinda.
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Thanks.
Okay, your highness.
But I already gave them back to you!
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
Gary.
Why not?
I, but you're so close! No!
Yeah, I've been around.
Great! Okay, good for you!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Why?
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
Thank you!
That's a good idea for a business!
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
But again, Simmons. Go on.
Hey you guys, guess what?
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
Hey you guys! Look!
What, what is that?
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
I think maybe, yeah.
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
Totally.
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Hey!
Hey!
Ugh!
Hey.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Hey! Oh!
Hey hey hey! She's on!
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
All right.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Oh, how did it go?
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Thank you so much.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
That's great Joe!
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Umm, where's my purse?
Could you speak up please?
I see what you're doing!
Oh, that's beautiful.
Ohh, ohh.
Then why did she ask us to...
Oh, fine! Take his side!
Nope.
Since when are you into swing music?
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Thank you.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
My little brother's getting married!!
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
She is so great! I miss her.
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
Hey!
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Hey!
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
This is Patrick.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
So how are things going with Paul?
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
How did you do that?
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Not a good day for birds...
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Thank you.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
Hello?
I think it's important that you do.
Saved your ass.
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Ohh. What is this?
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
You too!
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
No! Why?
Okay.
Does that mean Carcass is available?
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
But we've only had one job.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Okey-doke.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
That you don't stop talking about it.
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Oh, well, actually.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Thanks!
Yeah!
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
Uh-huh.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
They have the best stuff in there.
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Thanks.
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Yes, Denise. Denise!
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
Oh, I'd like that.
Joey? What's going on?
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
OOooooo!
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
No, but he's always late.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
Yeah, okay.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
I had one.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
We're practically kissing.
Why not?
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
What?
No, but you can't.
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
No, back to happy. Back to happy!
None the less.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Oh yeah.
That's great. Good for you guys.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
So did you ask him?
500 bucks at a flea market?!
How about we talk about this over dinner?
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Really? From who?
Janice? You called Janice?
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
No!
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Yeah.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Oh, you're such a cheater!
Ugh, I hate this year!
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Um, cake.
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Sur-surprise.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
So how did you know Francis?
Absolutely!
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
No, no, it's just my tooth.
Okay, bye.
Aw, dammit!
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
I have plans.
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
No listen to me! She is crazy!
Yeah.
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Monica!
Oh my God!
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Ready?
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
Rachel? Um, hi.
I am definitely gonna watch that!
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
I thought you meant in life.
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Why, nobody good?
Hey!
So what's going on?
I don't get it.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Yeah, yeah I got that.
Yeah.
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
That would be great. Thank you.
Umm, no thank you.
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Hey!
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
That is so sweet, you guys.
I don't have it!
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
Why not her?
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
Vince is a fireman.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Hey, Monica!
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Oh God!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
So is it like art?
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
See there it is right there.
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
Oh no!
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Hey.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Oh, hey!
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
What?!
Oops!
That and arrogance.
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
Hey!
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Can you hear anything?
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Wherere you going?
I know, I'm so excited!
Hey!
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
That sounds great!
Okay.
I would love it if I weren't here!
What? You'll hi-ya?
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Yeah. Sorry.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
No I didn't!
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
M-M-Mole people?
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
Ross, where did you get this?!
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
Yes.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Yeah? Why?
Yeah!
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
Oh my God. What happened?
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Okay.
Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
What?
Ohhh.
Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
Uh-huh.
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Uh-huh!
What?!
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Oh my God, so do I!
I think on some levels she already knows.
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
: Your Visa bill is huge!
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Why?
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
Hey!
And call me!
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
I'm still on "no."
Maybe you could be my roommate!
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Oh, oh! It's on again!
You have the power to do that?
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Yeah. Oooh...
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
Oh, but I can't do that-
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Hey!
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
Hey! Hi!
Okay, London 1...
No.
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Ugh, PBS!
But we have to!
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
What, what are they talking about?
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
See, he's her lobster.
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
With?
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
17 years ago.
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Oh my God!
Oh.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Okay.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
I'm sorry.
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Hi Ginger.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
I-I sure will, take care.
We want you to marry her!
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
I'm done now.
I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
No, you?
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Ooh, erotiery!
I stepped in something icky.
Janice.
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Yeah!
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Hey!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
Your getting married?!
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Which is why my answer is yes!
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
All right, so what were you thinking?
Are you okay?
Yay, okay!
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
But Mon, you have to get our money!
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
I love Jacques Cousteau!
Rach?
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
Oh here's a whole bunch.
What am I sitting on?
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Yeah! What are you saying?
I don't think you mean that.
Monica, leave him alone!
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Oh my God, you look so good!
What-what's up?
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Who the hell are all these people?
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
Ohhhh.
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Oh, me too!
YOU KNOW?!!!
Our mom.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Eww!
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Great! Thank you very much.
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Hi!
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Oh Chandler!
Thinkin' about it.
What the hell are you doing?!
Okay, bye!
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
What?
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Chandler, Chandler.
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
She's right! You have to stop!
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
...Flame Boy.
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
OK Joey, your bet.
What?!
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Stilts?
Ooh!
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Yep!
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
I want to keep one.
I know!
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Oh! What is that? What is that?
All right, Joey, same question.
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Your middle name is Pamela?
Yes! .... or no.
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
No!
What is that?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Hey.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Yeah, it was really hard.
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
No, there's no dog here?
Not that often!
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Oh, really.
You know he's gay?
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
She sells drugs to kids.
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
You wanna do it right now?
Hi.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
Why?!
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Okay. I'm going with you.
Ok, all right.
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
No.
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Na-uh, I am!
You ate meat! You had sex!
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
Oh, okay, oh.
Oh, okay.
Isn't he good?
I can do that for the kids.
So?
Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
Yeah, you never heard of them?
Come on, like you never talk that.
Does it look like a urinal?
Hey cool, mine too.
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Monica, you don't know that.
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
So-so you're really not going?
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
I love the license plate game!
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Oh my God!
Maybe it was the guy.
Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
Man alive!
Oh God.
Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!
Oh, have a great wedding!
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
Hey.
What?
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
I licked my arm, what?
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Please...wait, how did you do that?
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Rach, you're in my seat.
Nothing. Nothing.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Or you could end up with everything.
And this?
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Whatever.
But you guys came so close.
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
What?
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Oh yeah, that's over.
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
Ewww!
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Hey, what's going on?
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
Yeah?
What about this?
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
Really?! What's your name?
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Well, he's very charming.
Where were you?
Hi.
You're Frank Buffay?
So how long have you known?
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
The next, next?
Trouble?
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Ewww!
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Hi!
No, it's fate!
Hey! I call her!
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Duh!! Christmas!
Hi, so what happened?
Oh.
What?!
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Hey!
What are you saying I should do?
Cups? You're giving me cups?
Earl! I'm Phoebe.
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
What?
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Do you want a refill?
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
Hi!
Uh-hmm.
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Really?!
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Hey.
Yay me.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
You guys, he's beautiful!
Let's run towards them!
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Nothing-Why?!
Why?
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
God Joey, this is taking forever!
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Oh.
Okay!
But hes falling in love with her.
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
What is this? What's going on?
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
And a small piece of chocolate.
What umm, what happened?
Okay.
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
No.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Floopy?
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
Garfunkle.
I guess it was kinda funny.
I-I-I found it interesting.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
You can't give up on your dream.
Thank you, Monica.
Fine.
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Hm-mm, corn beef.
I think it went into me.
Okay.
Oh.
Monica.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
I don't use a curling iron.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Here. Y'know, just in case.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
You're welcome.
Which Richard?
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Bye, good luck.
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
Uh-huh.
Because you're marrying him!
Come on, take 'em off!!
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
No! No!
Oh my God.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
No!
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Bye.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Hey!
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
Yeah, why not?
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Hey Rach.
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
They are gonna love me.
Really?
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Huuh.
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Eh?
I know.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Hi.
Well, so do a lot of people.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
You didn't tell her did you?
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
I don't know. A cowboy theme?
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Never mind, I got it.
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Oh, yeah. What's this?
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Okay, they're just talking...
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Where?
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Hey!
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
That's so sweet.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
No!
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
That'll work too.
I've never done that.
I thought you knew that.
There's sooo much you don't know.
You told them he was missing?
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
To Ross.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
Yeah, swing music is so out.
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
I was in charge of cups.
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Oh, I see.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
I love this game!!
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Ben, dinner!
Yeah.
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Umm, oh, about three months.
How? How is your fault?
What?
Who was that?
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Okay, who's next?
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Hey!
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Alex Trebek?
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
I could do that.
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
You tired Chandler?
Petrie.
And, and!
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Okay everyone, think thick.
Hey!
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Yeah.
Yeah.
So nothing got ruined?
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Yeah. So?
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Oh, I...
No, I'm fine.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Hi!
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
What?!
Yeah, okay, my bad.
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Oh, hi.
They are. Why?
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Yep. Put more gas in.
No! Barry and Mindy.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Hey.
Rdtor.
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Hey!
I got it.
Hey.
On the touchy.
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
What?! Really?!
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
