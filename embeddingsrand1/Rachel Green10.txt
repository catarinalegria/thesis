Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Oh, the guys are here.
Ross!
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
