Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
There we go little fella.
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
And to you too, Helen.
...Quality, right, great.
You'll get one.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Right!
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
And the Knicks rule all.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
No!
You wanna play?
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
