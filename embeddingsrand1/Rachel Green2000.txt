Oh. That WENUS.
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Well, what is the other reason?
No-no, I'm staying put.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
What?!
Well what is it? Let me see.
Phoebe's...
Hi!
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Okay.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Oh, come on!
Hm-mm.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Ohh, not compared to you.
That's weird.
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Storming out!
Oh, they're firemen guys.
What?
Oh.
Drums?
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Just get out! Now!!
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
All right. Fine.
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Hey! We're here!
Sorry-
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Ohhh!!!!
You're out of Diet Coke.
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Why?
Okay!
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Oh my God!
I know.
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Well, I-I don't like it.
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
I just, I feel, I-I just...
I know!
What?!
Oh yeah? Fine.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
So did you break up with Joanna?
Oh, this is so cute.
Hey!
Really?
Phoebe?
Right.
Yeah, I do.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Ugh.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
You don't know?!
Ross's what?
Hi you guys.
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
No.
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
Grape.
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
Well no brush!
Thank you. Mon?
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
What?!
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Do I have my own castle?
Who is it?
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
But what about Phoebe?
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Oh really?!
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
I know, it's sick.
Okay.
All right, so we weren't prepared!
Oh.. a little..
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Who?
Hey!
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
Exactly!
Okay?
Ohh, that is soo sad.
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Ross, what's the matter?
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Ugh!
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Oh.
You promised you would break up with her!
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Great!
Phoebe, you're on.
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
Honey, I was wondering....
No-no, but I support it.
Hey, Pheebs!
No Joe, no miracle.
Look at that!
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
I haven't seen it yet!
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
What?
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
Chandler!!
Hey.
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Now, does it really matter?
Now that she broke up with you?
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
Hey, hubby!
Coming.
Good, good, good, good, good.
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
Right.
Oh, that is so sick.
So were done then!
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
No. Thank you.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Meeting Julie.
You know what?
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Wh-You dated my sister!
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
We do?
Monica, what should I do?
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
Hey!
Well there's an idea!!
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
It's the same story.
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
Hi.
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Um, hum.
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
No!
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
I love you too.
Yes! Did you see that?
I know.
What 'cha doing Mon?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Hi honey!
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
What?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
I don't!
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Yes!!
Ohh, thank you.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
No! Joey!
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
Sweety...
No.
Okay.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Really?! You think that will work?
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Oh!
Have at it.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Saw what?
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Hey.
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Oh.
Joey, do you have a minute?
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Really?
Ohh, yes.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
What?
...I mean it's my fault.
That is the most ridiculous.
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
What's your problem?
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Monica, please?
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Does it hurt?
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Yes it is.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Fourth gear!!
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
Oh my God!
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Yeah.
Really?!
What's this.
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
That's great!
Hello! Here we go!
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
What uh-oh?
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Hey.
Okay, here we go...
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Yeah...
Okay.
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
Ohhh!!
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Goodnight.
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
What?
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Well, they always called.
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
What!?
What?!!
Really?!
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
Oh.
What is the matter with you?!
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I'm sorry, what?
OK.
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Surprise!!
Why? I love that thing.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Ross.
No! I'm so happy for them!
Wow! If only more people knew.
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Okay..
No we...
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Well, how did you find out?
I tried! They won't take her back.
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Chandler!
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
You know what?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
Yes!
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Well...
"Ooo," what?
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
God, he's good.
Would you let me talk.
Monica, what are you talking about?
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
So umm, does it?
Hi.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Closer than here?
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Hello.
Sit down!
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Uh-huh.
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Ahh. Thank you!
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Thank you.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
So, how was the party?
He got it a flea market!
Yes.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
I know, I can do more than cook.
What's that?
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
Yeah.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
So, um, did she...
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
With ah, extra anchovies.
Oh my god.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
I know.
Monica.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
What?
Would you guys stop.
Yeah!
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Hey.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Uh-huh.
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Oh.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Are you okay?
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
No.
Sagittarius?
Well, what do you mean?
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Ohh, sorry.
That's a line from the show too!
No!
Hi Daddy!
Really?
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Okay.
That's great!
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Blow it.
Good!
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
All right. Be sexy.
Yeah, it's in there.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Yeah, great, you betcha!
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Yeah, like a chimney.
Who gave you that hickey?
Just get out! Now!!
Honey, this will help.
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Phoe-be!!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Okay!
I'm thinkin' no.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Hi, Pheebs.
Well look who's here!
What?
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Hi!
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Oohhh.
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
You have been maid of honor before?!!
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
What?
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Oh, hi!
Thank you.
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
Um, Russ, you ready?
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Well, thank you, Melanie.
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
Shut up!
Why?
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
Hey Joey, can I...
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Oh my...
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Okay.
Ewwww!!
Oh.
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Hi sweetie!
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
All right, Julie.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Oh!
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Ow, you stop flicking.
I haven't seen him in so long!
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
We won't?
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
What?
Okay, coming!
Because a car backfired?
Does anybody want anything else?
Ohh we're not sailing.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Hey, you guys...
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Wow... Wow!
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
I cannot believe her.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Hm-mmm!
Uh-huh.
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Wha...
You guys wanna get some coffee?
Hey.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
I can't believe this is happening.
What?!
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
What?!
All right.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Huh.. How about 600?
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Phoebe!
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
What?! Why?!
Get off.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Okay. Okay.
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
What?! Are you crazy?
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Hello!
Yeah!
I did.
Ben just said hi.
Yes?
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Yeah, what's it about?
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Because!
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
I've never wanted you more.
Hi Ross!
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Yeesss.
Ohhhhhhhh God.
I don't know.
Let us keep the apartment and...
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
Thank you!
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
Yeah. Well, umm.....
Hey!
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Oh.
All right.
What what what what?
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Just a bug.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Yeah, so?
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Fine!
He's like a big disgusting...
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Yeah?
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Yeah, it's just y'know...
So did you read your evaluation yet?
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Call her! Call her now!
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
What the hell is that?
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Thank you.
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Uhhhooo.
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
What?!
Hey, this is hollow.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Hey.
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Thank you.
Wow! How are you?!
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Okay. Wait! Wait!
I love it at Joey's!
Oh, was it awful?
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Oh my God!
This time it's not so funny.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Oh. Okay, bye.
What's up?
What?!!
Right!
Taurus?
What thing? What thing?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
I know that too.
All right, bye-bye.
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
But, but?
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Hi!
Okay, that is all you.
Hey.
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
What?!
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
I don't know where the phone is.
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Right.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
We're sorry.
What?!
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Yesterday!
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Gooood morning!!
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Right! You're right!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Yeah. Gotcha.
Okay.
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
You sure?
Oh, great.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay!
Together.
Hey!
Oh.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Oh crap!
Okay.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
I really think you need to go now.
HI!! Hi!
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
What? C'mon, talk to me.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
No.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Come on Joey!!!
Hey! Hi!
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
What?
I know, I remember that!
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
I had one.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ross!
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Goodbye, baby.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
Okay.
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
That had to hurt!
You put these on my desk!
Kinda.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
What is it?
I do.
Okay! All right! How was she?
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Credit.
Sure.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Just one cheek.
All right, well how much time do you need?
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
I know!
Hello.
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
What?! What? What happened?!
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Yeah.
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Hey!
Yeah!
Well I...
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
By all means.
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Really? How good?
Oh, my god.
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Well what happened at dinner?
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
No!
Yeah, it is.
Okay, who's next?!
What's going on?
Yes.
Hi!
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Oh. Right.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Well, but Pheebs.
How was the beach?
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
See? I've even called Animal Control!
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
No.
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Hi!
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Well neither do I!
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Ross thanks.
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
Pheebs?
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Hi!
What?
There you go!
Oh, it ended very well.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
Just stop it! Come on!
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Are you serious?!
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
What happened?
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
We're paying for this y'know.
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
What's that?
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Hi. I'm back.
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Well, whaddya think?
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Yeah.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Hey guys! What's...
You think about stuff like that?
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Yeah!
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
What do you, what do you mean?
Show time!
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Yeah.
Let's do it! Ross?
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Bye!
Yep!
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
Carol...Lesbian?
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
Let's dry 'em again.
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Yep!
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Well honey, what about you?
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.

Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
Yeah?
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Yeah.
Stop picturing it!!
Hey!
What?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Uh-hmm.
Really?
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
I did not sell you out.
Okay, they are.
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Monica, where did you get these?!
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
What are you shushing?
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Left.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
No way, forget it.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
That is the most ridiculous...
She didn't hang up either...
Well, it's about time.
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Oh, that is so sweet!
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Yeah.
Hey Mon!
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
Yeah.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Hi, sweetie!
Off to see young Ethan?
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Who's this from?
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Yeah, right.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
You like me?
Not at all inappropriate!
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Petty...
You stole them from me!!
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
What?!
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Thank you. What a bitch.
Good luck to ya!
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Why not?
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Oh wow!
Hey! Hi!
Yes, I realize that...
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
How come you didn't come over earlier?
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Bye hon.
It's Le Poo.
Ohh, ohh.
Oh! Pathetic!
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Oh.
Oh it's important!
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Better than Chandler.
What time is it?
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God.

Good for me!
Hey.
Ok?
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
Hello, Chip.
Hey!
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Okay.
You look so beautiful.
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Get up!
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
You were gonna drink the fat.

Ross kissed me.

Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...

Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Really? Really?!
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.

Macadamia nut?
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Hello, Paul.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
I'm sorry Joey.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Waitressing?
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Well...
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
Yeah. Nice try!
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Hey!
Well yeah...
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
What?!
Look at her.
Sure? Thanks.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
Yeah!
Ohh!
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Hey.
Hm-mmm.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
What is that noise?
I guess you weren't there.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
What's up?!
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Wow! What's that like?
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
How have you never been on Oprah?
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Hello.
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
Okay.
No you don't!
Because I lose her stuff!
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
But, it's not raining.
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
What?
Wait, so, you're going?
Who was that?
Ohh. Ooh!
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Ross!
Really!
Two, two babies?
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Did-did you take these back?
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
We won. We won!
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
We'll be right back sir.
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
Surprise!!!
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
I think it's sexy.
Oh come on, I already went.
Monica what?
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
In a month?
Oh my god.
Mon?
What?
D'oh!! I've got it!
That's nice.
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Great!
Rachel.
What?! You say that to kids?!!
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Maybe you should put it off.
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
Yes it is!
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Agghhh.
Uhh.... waitressing?
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Ohh that's nice.
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
What?!!
Done.
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
But we should move quick.
Ohh, well you got 'em.
I don't know. The left one.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Yes!
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
My God!
They're not true?
I know.
What!
You all know? Does Ross know?
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
We're gonna find love!
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
You didn't get it?
All right!
Oh that's what you want.
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
I'm sorry, what?
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
You just said it!
Wow!
Would anybody like more coffee?
Ross, you don't know that.
It was nice to meet you.
Yeah.
Oh, Kim, Hi.
Oh.
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
That's....
What the hell was that?!
I know!
Joey!
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
What?
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
Ow!
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Well...
What?
You're twins?
: Loser?
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Oh, he sees her!
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
Your company has a fine foods division?
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Okay.
Um... Ross?
Rosss...
Hi.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Ross, you know what...
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
Ross, I really don't think...
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
Really?
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Oh, what a fun office.
Great set tonight Phoebs.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Okay? You ready?
No you don't know why!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
That would be great!
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
Do what, do what?
Come on you gotta have one!
Yes.
Ohh...
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Come on, show me.
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
Jeez!
He doesn't speak much English.
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Okay.
What's going on?
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
What?
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Wow! What do you do now?
Oh my God.
Wow.
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Oh, right, clink.
Uh-hmm.
Uh-huh.
Yeah?
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
Yeah?
Hey!
Small...
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
That's right!
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Yeah, I...
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Over here!
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
What?!
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
What's goin' on?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Really.
Hey! Hey!
I'm just making margaritas.
Hi Pheebs!
Yeah.
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
All right, straight, and not subtle.
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Oh!
I'm Rachel Green.
Yeah?
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Yeah, sure.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Oh my God! How?!
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Yeah?
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Yes, we do.
Oh, yeah.
Bye-bye-e!
Sp-spoil?
Surprise...
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Ohh! Oh my God!
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Hi!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Uh-huh.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Yeah?
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Who got married?!
Op, ice. I need ice.
Oh my God.
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Said what? Exactly.
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Well why shouldn't I?!
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Ohh, great!
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Yeah, come here!
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
OK, that's dead right?
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Well, there you go!
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Aw, Mon...
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
How many you want?
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
What?!
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Really?
What?
Thank you.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
I cannot push it in!
What?! You got us evicted!!
How is that the silver lining?
Hey.
Ohh! Hi!
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Joey!
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Oh my God!
What's 1922?
Mon. Hi!
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Say it!
Hi!
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
I got the job!
Hi!
Okay. Let's use this brush.
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Ooh, it was only okay.
Uh-huh.
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Hi!
Why on earth would I understand this?
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
I know!
Ok.
People are trying to sleep in here!
Oh, do I?
All right. I'm a total pro!
Okay. Okay!
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
May fifth, why?
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
What? Guys, I'm not.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Bye-bye.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Ahhhh.
Hi!
It sure is.
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
I bet you're a Gemini.
No, I don't.
Hey!
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
You can?
What's this?
Uh, Joey..
Charming.
What?
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Hi.
Oh my god!!
Oh, yeah go ahead.
We ended up having sex in his chair.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Oh-ow!
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Oh!
Relaxi-Taxi!
I've never lived like this before.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Yes!
Wow.
Really?
Heard what?
Hey, Monica!
Oh.
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Arghh!!
Oh no, you're the best.
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Okay.
Well neither do I!
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
So it would just be, me alone?
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
What?
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
AND YOU KNOW!!!
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Coffee.
Yes!
No.
Okay.
I don't want to say.
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
...if you tell me, I might do it.
He's not 11!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Y'know...
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Well, I-I guess-I...
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Really?!
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Care for a cherry?
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
That's 'cause you have it.
Hi.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Oh yeah surfer?
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Probably just the first half.
Hi!
Hi.
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
No, wait. Wait.
Because! Because I was sad.
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
What?
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
Do you guys know any cute guys?
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
OK, then get me your purse.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
What?
Phoebe's...
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
What?! What?! What?!
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Oh. Stop it!
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Monica, I'm your best friend.
Hey.
Hello!
Oh, yeah.
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Well...
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
Yeah! Why?
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
I have one.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Awww, just like his daddy.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Oh I...
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Now I love you even more.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Impressive.
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Oh-oh, you lie.
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
That's a good call. Right.
Ow!
Yeah me too.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
Sure.
For Ross, Ross, Ross.
Well why didn't you take the job?
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Okay!
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
I can't believe you would say that!
All right.
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
I love working with designers!
Huh.
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Stevie the TV?
Noooooooo!
No! Nothing!
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
Hey!
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Great! Monica's moving!
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Oh-oh!
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Ive never done that.
Ewwww!!
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Yeah. A year ago..
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Oh yeah, what's it about?
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Fine.
That is so cool.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Op! We gotta go!
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Hi!
Well, it's my cat.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Yeah!!
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
Let me, let me get you some wine!
You remember Ross.
Good.
Really?!
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
And all these people actually died?
Yes.
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...
Noo.
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
You don't even know!
No, yeah, Ive done that.
Hi you guys.
Really? Mine too.
Bye, Pheebs.
Uh-huh.
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Smell familiar?
Y'know Marcel?
Hi.
No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
Hey. Got a second?
Okay!
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
I believe it.
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Arghhhh!!!!!!
Yeah.
Look, either help me or go.
Hey!
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Oooh!
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Oh.
Look at that!
Oh, Mon, sure.
Hi, thanks for coming.
Do you want me to quit?
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
I have absolutely no idea.
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Hey!
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
What's up?
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
Ross!
32.
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
I promise.
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
From now?
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
I know.
What's up Joe?
Yes, I do.
Goodnight.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
What?!
Oh, god.
With Ross and my sister?
Almost.
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
I did!
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Oh! That's fine.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
I thought it was Chandler!
Oh.
Hi!
What?!
Well, people are different.
I'm an assistant buyer!!
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Well umm...
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Y'know, all the women.
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Wow.
OOooooo!
Right.
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Hi!
No so we're protecting her.
What?
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
Yes, you did.
Very nice touch.
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
No. A break from us.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
Ok.
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
And?
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
That almost hit me in the face.
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
Ohhh!
Oh, sorry.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
And Mrs.?!
And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Mexico?
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Here you go. Thank you!
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Hi.
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Ohh whoops.
Okay.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Oh.
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
I won't boss you around.
Well I. . .
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
That's right!
Hey Pheebs.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Do you?
Hi!
That wouldn't help me.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Does anybody need more coffee?
Oh my God!
Good, you guys are all here!
Joey! Joey, good one!
Who is being loud?
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
I don't know!
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Career counselor?
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Oh, great!
Yeah?
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Look!
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Insane!
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Pretty much.
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Um-hmm.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Anymore!!
Yes, and grumpy.
Okay, what's up?
He's perfect, he's never been better.
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
I don't know.
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Monica.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Really?
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Oh, look at the little cat!
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wh?!
Oh, honey that's awful.
I'll get her.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
They're male nurses.
Uh-huh.
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
Umm...
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
What? You didn't get one.
Right!
Oh my God!
