So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Oh yeah.
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
I'm going for a walk.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
What?!
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Hey!
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Oh, come on squeeze it.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
Yeah.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Hi you!
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Oh yeah, no, what's that?
Okay.
Okay.
All right, then you owe me $350.
Okay. I am so hot!
But I...
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Ohh, thank you.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
How did it go with Erin?
Yeah?
Joey!
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Hey Joey, can I...
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Oh, good for you!
D'oh!! I've got it!
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Is-is he coming?
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Excuse me. Hi.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Uh-huh.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Oh, can we read them?
Okay.
Sure? Thanks.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Bob Buttons?
What?
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Me?!
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
...Jack from downstairs?
Joey, did you my face cream?
Noooooooo!
Hmmm!
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Really?! How do you know?
What?
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
Stop picturing it!!
I know, it's sick.
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Hey!
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Oh, Ross...
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Huh umm...
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
What?!
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Oh Ross, you're so great.
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
Together?
Yes!
Oh!
Hey!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Hi.
Uh-huh.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
What the hell is that?
Let me get my coat.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
: We have apple cinnamon...
Yeah.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
I don't know, I don't know.
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Did you talk to him?
No?
A scooter!
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
Yeah.
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Ohh!
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Ohh! That's great!
Three of your five, what?
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Okay!
Well...
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Now I love you even more.
Monica's making jam.
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Bye hon.
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Hey you!
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Wh-what do you mean?
Does anybody need anything?
Absolutely not.
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
Oh.
Hey.
Gimme a 'Y!'
All right, bye-bye.
Okay.
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Okay.
OK, OK, it's my turn.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
Basketball!
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Really?
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Did you know he was in there?
All right, I got 48.
Well there's an idea!!
What bank is this?
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Oh! What's new in sex?
Aww, look at the little thing.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Oh, hi!
No you don't know why!
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
I know.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Hi.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Yes.
Oh.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Thank you.
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
No.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Ross gave it to me.
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Yes, I realize that...
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
Interesting.
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Oh. Right.
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
What?! Why?!
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Ugh.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
I tried! They won't take her back.
Yes.
Hi.
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
That'd be good.
You guys wanna get some coffee?
We're sorry.
Uh, credit card.
Yeah?
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Yeah!
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Great.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
You like me?
How did it go?
Yeah!
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
Oh, I....
Because I promised Mindy I would.
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Yes!
Marcel?
Let's dry 'em again.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Oh hi!
Closer than here?
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Oh, hi sweetie.
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
You remember Ross.
Meeting Julie.
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
Oh, you go out with him.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
It's not a big deal!
The commercial?
Oh please, they're having sex.
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Right.
Who?
Oh! That's fine.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Oh, god.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Because a car backfired?
Huh. A moo-point?
We need a hat..
Hmm.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Hi!
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
What?
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Chandler!
You?
Yes!
Oh, right, that's me!
Gay? Yeah.
Bye.
Hey!
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
I did.
What's the matter?
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
What?!
Ross! Janice?!
Right!
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Hey, you.
What?!
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Right.
Oh, do I?
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Barry?!
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Sophisticated like a hooker?
See? Now, he could date her.
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
"Oh, my, god."
OOooooo!
How did you make $17.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Ross, what's the matter?
Oh, hi.
Oh, he sees her!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Don't call us that!
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Yeah.
Pheebs...
Very nice touch.
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Hey!
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Um, everyone?
Okay.
I'm sorry, let her?
Oh yeah, there you go.
Oh, that's true.
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Ahh. Thank you!
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
What're you guys doing out here?
And-Joey!
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Ok.
Oh my God.
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Yeah, I know.
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Hey!
I don't get this! She was horrible!
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
It's fine.
I mean, this is unbelievable.
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Monica, is this true?
I'm Rachel Green.
Op, I like credit cards!
What?
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Yeah, he broke those too.
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
All right, I like that.
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Gimme the keys!
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
Big night!
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Oooh!
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
I know! What?!
Who?
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
So, will I like any of these guys?
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Hey!
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Uff.
Right?
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
What are you reading?
Hey! Hi!
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Hi!
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Really?
I'll go with you.
Oh, you got me.
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Hi!!
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Hi!
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Oh God, absolutely.
Ahh!
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Get off.
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Oh Pheebs.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
OH MY GOD!!!
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
What is the emergency?!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Aghh.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Mr. Treeger.
Hey, uh, Joey?
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Hey.
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
You're kidding.
I don't know!
Well, you would know.
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Bye, Pheebs.
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Would you guys stop.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Oh, thank goodness!
Oh, that is so sweet!
You really think it would be that different?
Call her! Call her now!
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
You don't.
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
'Kay.
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
I went really long.
Okay. Wait! Wait!
What did you just say?
Okay.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Really? You think so?
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
You're welcome.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Pick one.
I'm thinkin' no.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
What'd you get?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Yeah, so?
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Hi!
Good.
Are you kidding me?
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
I didn't know that.
Hey!
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
Yeah, I can do that.
What 'cha readin'?
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Are you sure?
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
Y'know what?
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
What?
Fine.
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Yeah.
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
Me too!
Coffee.
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Because I'm going to London.
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Ow! Ow!
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Blow it.
But I...
Allll done!
Bathroom's up there.
Yeah.
Great.
No, forget it.
Oh yeah.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Well no brush!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Sophie sit!!
Amazingly, that makes sense.
But, it's not raining.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Storming out!
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
No, we never do that
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Yeah.
No..!
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Yeah.
I know.
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Aw, I love that.
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
Oh sure it is!
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Wow! What do you do now?
Noooo.
Really? Really?!
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Yes! Totally!
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
What?
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Well that's his last name.
The bll is drrbing!
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Oh, right, clink.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Hi.
Oh. That WENUS.
We do?
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Ball? There is no ball.
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
But, but?
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
No?
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
This is totally your fault!
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
That was not funny!
Any sign of your brother?
Uh-huh.
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
...it's gonna be okay!
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
Um. yeah.
What do you, what do you mean?
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Okay, that is all you.
Oh, she does want to.
Oh.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
Ohh, ohh.
You let Joey drive it?!
Yeah right.
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
Yes I am!
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Oh no!
Oh!
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
Well, what about my stuff?
If we broke up, and I lost you...
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Oh.
Okay.
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Well, have fun!
What, what incident?
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Ohh, ohh.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
But I hired you!
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Huh?
Oh, this is just terrible.
Are you pregnant?!
Hi!
Relaxi-Taxi!
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
DANGER!!!!!
Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Hey!
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
Nooo!
Oh my God!
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Hey.
I know. I'm sorry.
What?!
What? C'mon, talk to me.
Yeah!
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Yeah.
The fear?
This is just occurring to you?
What?
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
All right. Be sexy.
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Ohh, great!
I think he's across the hall.
What?
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Yeah, she's...
What do you mean?
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Nobody.
Yeah, you do.
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
No. No, you can't.
With Ross and my sister?
He carries a briefcase.
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
It's worse than the thumb!
You don't have birds.
Huh.
Nothing! You go!
Okay!
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
What? Wait, what?
Oh my....
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
So were you guys together a long time?
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
I don't have ten minutes!!
Great!
There's more alcohol, right?
Why aren't you at work?
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
That would be great!
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
Oh!!
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Monica.
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Ohh, yes.
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Oh!
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Okay.
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
I don't want you to see me naked!
We won't?
Hi!
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
What? Who?
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Bye, Chandler.
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
I know, I can do more than cook.
Yeah.
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Yeah.
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Goodnight.
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
Oh my God!
So....
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
You are soo enjoying this.
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
What-what are-what are these?
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Yes.
Okay.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Yeah that works.
Okay!
Why, where are you going?
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Almost.
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Oh, sorry.
I'll get her.
Oh.
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Sure.
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Yes.
All right? Thank you.
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
No.
Hey!
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Well now what's the rush?
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Because, he's my friend.
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Phoebe?
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Coming.
No. No-no-no-no.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Close call day.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
That's not the end.
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
Hi!
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
What?
Oh, I know.
Ohh that's nice.
Monica! Come on!
Oh.. a little..
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Why.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Y'know what you should do?
What?
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Okay! All right! How was she?
What?
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Men just take out wind?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
What?
Look, either help me or go.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
We ended up having sex in his chair.
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Umm, hi!
Does it still hurt?
Just give us our apartment back!
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
Some of them.
Okay.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Ooh, let's open them!
Kinda.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Okay.
I promise.
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Hi Daddy.
Ohh...
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Oh!!
That's just great.
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Who gave you that hickey?
What?!
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Uh-hmm.
What's going on?
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
You're so pretty.
Ow!
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
You didn't get it?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Ohh...
Ahhhh!!
Do you even know what a vicar is?
It-it did!
What?!
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Yeah?
Something to do with numbers?
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Yeah!
Yeah?
No. No.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
It's a pretty cool tux.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Yeah.
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
No.
Sweety...
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
I don't know!
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
For...me.
Whoa-ho.
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
What?!
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Right.
Oh, I read that in high school.
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Hi honey!
Hi you guys.
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Okay.
Oh come on, I already went.
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Okay.
Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Well umm...
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Well you better.
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Hey.
Yeah.
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
What?! No! Why?!
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Ohh!!
Barry who I almost.
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Yeah.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Oh it's important!
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Oh yeah, what's it about?
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
I don't think so.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Hey, nice toilet.
Oh, okay, not so weird.
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Was that the cake?
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
Oh, look at the little cat!
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
Oh, Mon, sure.
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Hi!
Guess what?
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Uh-huh!
Oww!
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
How is she?
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Oh! Ow!
Oh.
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
More than jewelry.
You found me a guy?
What's that?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Chandler, what did she say?
All right!
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
What?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Op.
What?
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Do you have any ice?
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Ugh!
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Good.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
She-she died Jill.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
So did you break up with Joanna?
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Sp-spoil?
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Oh.
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Yeah.
Okay!
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
I'm not gonna gooo.
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Oh come on Ross!!
I cannot believe her.
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Good, you guys are all here!
Really?
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Really?
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Oh no.
No!
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Hey!
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Ooh great! Very Monica.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
No!
Hey!
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
Uh-huh.
All right.
Sure.
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Oh, seriously?
They're not true?
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
What time is it?
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Phoebe!
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
I can't, I gotta go.
Okay, let me just change.
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
Guess!
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Thank you. Mon?
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
No, I don't.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Great set tonight Phoebs.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
Shut up!
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
What?
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Yeah...
Ughh!
You went shopping for fur?
No, God! Please, let me!
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
Great!! That's great!
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
A lover?
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
That's a good story, Grandpa.
What happened?
Hi! Phoebe.
Uh-huh.
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
No it's not!
Yeah!
Yeah.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
I know...
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
Oh, get out of here!
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Rock-paper-scissors?
Oh.
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Oh yes.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Oh dear God.
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Ross's what?
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
What?
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
I need some milk.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Oh, God...
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
Oh?
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
So?
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Does anybody want anything else?
There. Now there is.
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Okay.
Because I knew you were lying!
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
A thousand bucks.
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
To get you to make out with him!!!
Okay? You ready?
Really?!
Hey.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Ooooh yeah.
What are you going to make?
What?
Ok, who ordered what?
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Oh.
Okay then!
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
And Monica, what are you going to make?
What the hell was that?!
What was the book?
Hey!
Ok honey, you really need a job.
All right!
Hi.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
OK!
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
Monica, what are you talking about?
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Fine!
Mindy.
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
What am I making him by the way?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Okay.
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Ohh, sorry.
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
So?
Just washing the windshield.
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Well, that's great.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Well, what are you going to wear?
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
All right, fine.
That's a line from the show too!
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
Ok, so let's talk money.
How was the beach?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
What?!
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Hey!
What? Wait, what?
I thought it was Chandler!
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Hi!
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
I don't know.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Okay.
Water it is.
Surprise me.
Oh, great.
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Hi!
I'm not in love with Ross!
Hey Pheebs.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
Yeah? You like that one?
None for me.
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Oh my God.
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
What? You're leaving?!
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
You guys! You guys!
Yeah. Hmmmm.
Oh...
Yep!
I'm an assistant buyer!!
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
So this is Brooklyn.
Ok.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
I don't know. The left one.
Macadamia nut?
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Hey Joey!
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Okay.
Okay.
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Absolutely! Absolutely!
What are you guys doing?
Sucker!
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Hey!
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Um-hmm, yeah.
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
How long?
Okay, here we go...
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
OK.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Ohh! That's so great!
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Ohhh!!!!
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Okay, I heard that.
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Say it!
I know!
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Oh no, you're the best.
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Yeah, I'm good.
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Yeah, what?
What?
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
A big idiot.
You never come into this office again!
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
You know what?
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Do you guys want these?
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Okay.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
What was that?
Thanks!
What?
Is he romantic with her?
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Not unless different means the same.
Um... Ross?
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Yeah.
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Oh, I would love to!
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Well, things change.
Ohhh.
Hi!
Ok.
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Hey!
Do you want some pancakes?
Hi!
We have to get her a present?!
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
I gotta go!
Uh... I don't know.
Yeah?
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
Okay, I do.
And Mrs.?!
Because I lose her stuff!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Oh, howd she take it?
Okay. Okay.
No.
Ross.
Who is it?
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Hey!
Well, I-I don't like it.
Yeah!
Aw, Mon...
What's the other one?
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
I've never wanted you more.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Just one drink?!
I could not have done this without you.
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Rachel...
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Thank God. Food.
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
Yes.
Okay that is the one we already have!
He got it a flea market!
What? You didn't get one.
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Great! Monica's moving!
Well try to keep it down.
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Wh?!
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Monica? Monica!
Yeah.
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Hey! We're here!
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Ohh, with who?
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
What?!
It'll be a short one.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Oh damnit!
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Ethan called again.
Hey.
Hello?
Ohh, I would love too.
Rob Tillman!
Then what's gonna happen?
Oww!
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Are you gonna let me play?
Honey, I was wondering....
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
I don't want to say.
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Um... Done!
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Let's roll!
What are you saying?
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Sure. You got it. Great!
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
I get to hire my own assistant!
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Monica, what are you doing?
Ow!
No-no, I'm staying put.
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
What?!
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Chandler!
Oh! Pathetic!
My God!
No.
Oh! I used to do that too!
You do?
Uh-huh.
Well um, I don't.
Are you kidding?!
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Drums?
Its back in cage!
Very good.
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
Yes.
Really?!
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
What?!
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
This is how I would hold a football.
I know.
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Career counselor?
It is our first official date. Our first date.
We are so gonna find them this year.
Yeah.
Hi.
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
I haven't seen it yet!
All right!
Thank you Phoebe.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Yes. You're not asking are you?
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
32.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
All right!
That's weird, she locked the door.
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Well neither do I!
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
What?!
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Hey!
Oh Ross, you're so great!
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
Oh, that sounds great.
What?
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Oh! It's you. Hi.
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Hi!
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
I didn't... I never said that.
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Yeah!
I-I-I don't know.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
He doesn't speak much English.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
Your fly is open, Geller.
Pretty much.
What is this? What are we doing?
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Time is money my friend?
One two three.
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Rachel...
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
What party?
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Do what, do what?
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
leave...
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
Really?!
I'm not telling.
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Yeah!
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
How-how did you lose your job here?
What?!
Oh, hi!
Okay.
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Get up!
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
Monica, where did you get these?!
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
Give it here. Oh, God.
Well, so what does he do?
Okay.
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Oh, god.
Hi.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
So what-what is the exhibit.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
All right.
What?!!
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Hey, Monica!
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
And heels.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Yeah.
Well, it's my cat.
How are ya?
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Oh, okay.
Okay, a thousand.
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Why?! What is it?
Oh, what a fun office.
Men are unbelievable.
Excuse me?
Wait! Okay!
Oh my God.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Up!
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
I'd wait.
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Bye-bye Julie.
Oh my God!
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Yeah, I'm just mad!
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
Uh-huh.
Really?
Full house.
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
You're jokin' right?
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Wow! How are you?!
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Yes!
Hey.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Hey!
Ugh! What grandmother?
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
What did you get her?
Unbelievable.
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Hi!
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
...how about I move in with you?
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Funny book?
Really?!
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Okay! All right! How was she?
Okay.
Eww!
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
What?
I don't know, I don't know.
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Nothing.
Yeah?
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Hey! What's up?!
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
What?
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
You were gonna drink the fat.
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
There you go!
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Give me that!
Yes, Ross.
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
Oh so-so not really never.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
What does she mean?
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Who is it?
Everybody...
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
Yeah, you bet.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
Oh my God.
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
All right. Fine.
No!
And you know Monica and Ross!
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
What?!
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Well what is it? Let me see.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
...if you tell me, I might do it.
What's that?
Really?!
You know what?
But he has to know how I feel!
Ohh.
No.
C'mon up.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Um, Russ, you ready?
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
It's really not that big!
Well, you should have.
I know!
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Get your hands out of there! No!
Hey! What's up Mon?
Well, look at that, same thing.
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
What?
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Well I. . .
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
Sure.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Okay.
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Are you serious?
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
Hello.
Yeah, she's gay.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
Uh-huh.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
You are asking me to be your wife!
Y'know Marcel?
Okay.
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Hi!
Uhh.... waitressing?
I know.
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Yeah, come here!
Wow!!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Exactly!
Ohh, God.
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Huh. All right.
Yes it is.
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
Yes.
Wow.
Damn!
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
What thing? What is this thing?
Hey Mon!
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
No. I...
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
When did you go to a sperm bank?
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Nope!
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Joey?!
You will like it!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Because, uh-it has to.
What's the matter with you?
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
Bye!
Really?!
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Oh.
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
No, no, ACC-cept that.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
