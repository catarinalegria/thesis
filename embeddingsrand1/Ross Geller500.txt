Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Dude, what'd you have?
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Okay.
Mmm.
Yeah, cheerie-o!
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Oh.
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
We?! We angered it?!
Meth-methane smells...
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Mrs. Bing.
What?!
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
Just a smidge.
Go Joe!!!
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
I am a good kisser.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Oh man.
Okay.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
What?!
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
What's she look like?
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Yeah.
Sorry.
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
What?
I'm gonna tell Mom.
Yeah!
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
Ahhhh!!
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
What?!
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
All right, try pedaling.
Well, now I do!!
Easy.
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Yeah, okay.
Aww.
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Well, last weekend...
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
What are you guys doing later?
Nope.
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Yeah.
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
I am your friend.
Hey guys.
There's other stuff too.
Is this?!
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
What?! What?!
Hey!
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Oh-ooh!
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Mine.
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
How's the maniac?
Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
I guess so.
So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
What?
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
No.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
How could you tell her?!
Thank you.
No you don't.
So uh, Emily called last night...
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Hey!
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
It's morphin time!
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Happy Thanksgiving!
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Huh.
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
Yeah?
That word was swans.
Hi.
Okay.
Are you OK?
That bitch!
I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
No, you stop!
Please don't say naked chicks.
Oh! That's nice.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Huh?
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
How can you not believe in evolution?
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
What happened you guys?
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Y'know what...
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Okay, can we just sign please?
Cassie?
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Or Joseph.
Tony?
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
People can hear you.
All right, did you just say all right?
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Hello!
That's okay.
Wow! You-you look great!
I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
Huh.
Oooooh.
Hey.
11, unbelievable 11 is correct. All right, that's 4 for the guys. Ladies, you're up.
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
I was thinkin' about it.
There you go. Thank you!
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Well, you just...
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Hmm.
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
What's-what's going on?
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Easy.
She looks so small.
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
Ugh, museum.
Oh, right!
What?!
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
I get it! Well, that's that.
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
That little naked guy would be me.
No! You let go!
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
What? Let me see.
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Yeah!
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
That is an old, Chinese woman!
Must pee.
You got it.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
What?
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
That's cool.
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Okay.
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
What? What's wrong?
Well that I can believe.
Nope! Something else.
Hey!
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Goodnight.
Wh-what did he say?!
Wow!
Okay.
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
Yeah!!
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
She's not Rachel.
Thanks Rach.
No? What happened, big guy?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Wow, hello! You look great!
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Wow, that's-that's-that's incredible.
Four.
Thank you.
Oh God!
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
I think it's insane.
Play it.
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Hi!
Hey!
Rachel!! Monica!!
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Here's my retainer!
Do you know the word crapweasel?
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Yeah.
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
Buddy, my monkey?
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
What?
Ah.
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Okay.
We're looking into it.
Again, very sorry.
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Oh, mine's December...
No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Yeah! Got it!
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Yeah.
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
No, but, your-your mad.
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Really?
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
We're not done.
Yes it is. See.
No.
All right.
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Challenge excepted.
Yeah, of course, Donald.
Why?
Oh hey, hey Mark.
Oh. And what do you call that?
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Mm-hmm..
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
They have another guess.
Surely you can think of something good.
Yeah!
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
I had a problem.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
Ok, dinner's on.
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
Can I ask you somethin'?
Yes, I do.
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Hi. She said yes.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
My God.
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
And on your anniversary, for shame!
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Come on, seriously.
Yeah, right!
Emily.
Oh thanks!
What?
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Hey Rach!
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Well, we should probably get going.
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Technically, huh, no.
Mon, look who I ran into!
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Over my dead body!
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
About what?
Die Hard!!!!!!
Okay, good luck
That would be me.
Huh, I'm just saying...
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Yeah.
Hey does anyone have any gum?
I didn't get the annulment.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Oh, oh Chandler...
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Bye.
I'm gonna be on TV!!
Oh, this is Monica.
Why? What?
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
Why are we in bed together?
FINE BY ME!!
Hi.
Hey.
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
What? What's on your shoulder?
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Well, he had gravity boots.
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Uh-huh.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
So?
Of course she would, you're a college man.
What? Where?
No, 10 is the highest.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
Alright.
A lot of other gas smells...
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
Who's Chip?
Uh, hello!
Hey, there.
Yep! That's hilarious!
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
That's closer.
First of all, I'm not losing...
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Geez! Are you ready?
Yeah.
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
It's just I miss her so much.
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Ohh.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Yes.
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Five letters.
Uh-huh.
Bye Ben.
Yes, exactly!
Hey, I've been married 3 times
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
Sorry.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
Dude, you are sick.
Yep.
Okay.
Oh that's nice.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
This is-you-
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Hey, I might!
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
Oh. Uhh...
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
