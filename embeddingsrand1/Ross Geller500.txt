Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Who's your roommate?
Hey Rachel.
I hear ya.
What's goin' on?
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Here's your girlfriend's button.
None.
Hiiiiii.
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
Die Hard!!!!!!
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Okay, quick and painful.
She's dating. She's dating.
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
Yeah.
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
Yeah, right!
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
Yeah.
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
....................Yeah.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Oh.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
See?
All right, see you guys.
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
...since I stopped trying.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
What? Let me see.
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
OK, now I'm nervous.
How could you tell her?!
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
No?
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Yeah.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Hey!
You really didn't know?
That's it, your doing great.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Happy Thanksgiving!
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Yeah!
Me too!
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Hey.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What??
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
...Chandler!
I do too! I do too!
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Okay, break-up's still on!
You know what I like most about him, though?
He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Sorry.
Well, the lighting was okay.
Huh?
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
A little.
Hi.
Yeah? How much?
So Joey, you okay?
Mon?
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Okay. Hut! Hike!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Hi!
Hey Rach.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Oh-ho, okay.
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Err, right.
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
'My scones.'
Buy mommy.
I'm the ring bearer.
You hated me when we were kids?
Hey!
Hello.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
That's right!
College?
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
How can you not believe in evolution?
Some of your old stuff.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Oh, I am very in.
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
She's not Rachel.
So how'd it go?
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Then where the hell have you been?!
Yeah?
Any time.
What?
FINE BY ME!!
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
No, no he's not.
What-what is it?!
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
What are you, what are you doing?
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Hey.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
What?
Man, I sure miss Julie.
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Yeah.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Susan Sarandon.
That would be me.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
What? What? What?!
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Hey Chandler. Monica!
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Okay, good bye!
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Phoebe? Phoebe?
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Are you out of your mind?
So, what's going on now?
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Chandler!
Rach...
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
It was just a kiss.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Hey, you guys.
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
I am!
Ohh... OK.
A what?
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
All right.
Sure. Joey...
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
Hey!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Oh.. oh... oh.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
You're over me?
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
This one?
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
You're not laughing.
Try the bottom one.
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
Hey!
All right. I think it was a mouse.
The big book of childrens' names.
KARL!
Yeah.
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
I fell asleep!
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
OK. Hold my board.
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Umm, no.
Yeah.
How 'bout Ben?
Step back.
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
Hey.
Phoebe.
Cool!
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
I can't catch a break!
Yeah!
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Still thinking about it huh?
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
We'll give you Janice.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
Mon, look who I ran into!
What?
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
I know that!
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
Yeah.
Mon.
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Really? That's great!
Dr. Franzblau, hi.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Alright boys, let's eat.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
I'm gonna use the cushion.
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
What? What? What? What is it?
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
We're good.
Why is it inside out?!
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Okay.
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
Oh, right!
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
It was a dry day.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
Susan, go deep.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Is that so?
Oh my God. Congratulations.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
You tell them to wait!
All right.
Same difference.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Uh-huh.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Hi everyone.
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Oh!
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Naked friends.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
No you're not.
Hey you.
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
Yeah.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
What's wrong with being the Bings?
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
What happened?
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
One.
What?
Wow!
A date.
You're not going to go.
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
Good for you.
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
I'm so proud of you.
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
That's okay.
Yeah?
No, because your not upset.
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Who needs a lease when it's family!
Hey!
No-o-o! No way!
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Hey Mon!
No!!
All right.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
I do have a newfound respect for life.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Okay.
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Ok, Mom never hit.
Yeah! Got it!
Hey.
Ssshh.
Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
Cheers!
I guess so.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Okay, good-good for you.
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
What's her last name?
Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
Yeah.
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
Yeah!
...What shoe?
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Okay.
Joey?!
Hello.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Paolo. Hi.
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Can't we just use a pen?
What-why?
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
What, what oh....
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
You think?
Eat your fish.
Why?!
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
What?
Unagi. I'm always aware.
What are you doing here, Santa?
No, that's fine.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Oh, hello.
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
No!
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Hey.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Mmmm.
I'm not a nice guy.
Well, these. These are yours right here.
How's the hair?
You're bleeding.
What? What?
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
Must pee.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
What time?
Mm-hmm..
That's all you're basing this on?
Well, but, but. . .
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
How about you?
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Sure, okay.
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Okay! All clear!
No?
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
No!
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
Small...
Why?
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Lucky sixes....
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Dear Lord!!
What?
Yeah.
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Hey Rach!
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Hey, what you do on your own time...
That's correct. Ladies?
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Oww!
I was just leaving.
Fine.
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
Hey!
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Yeah, okay.
