I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
Mailbox.
Ow!!!
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Um, do you wanna sit?
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
What?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
No! You should've read it yourself!
Hey.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Yeah?
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
I'm sorry, I'm late.
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
What about this?
Oh, that's fine, no.
Hm-mmm.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
What?
Hmm, bummer.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
Watching ballroom dancing?
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
Yeah!
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
'Kay, put your head back.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Okay... Okay.
Getting so good at that!
The next, next?
And why not?!
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Uma Thurman.
Okay. No. But thanks.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Yeah? Hi!
Sure!
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Just kidding!
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Not a good day for birds...
Secret affair!
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
What about my cab?
Do you like car games?
Yeah, you never heard of them?
Chandler.
Ross?!
That's too hard. Too hard!
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
Oh my God!
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
Swear?!
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Oh, what? What was it?
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
I want to keep one.
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
Woo-yay!!
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Hee hee!
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
No.
OK Joey, your bet.
Hey.
Everything you've heard is true.
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Nope, not knocked up yet.
Ok, that's so nice.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Then do Iceberg!
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
You make it so funny.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Ahh.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
Please...wait, how did you do that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
Hey!
Huh?
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
It's Phoebe.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Are you crazy?
All right, so, okay...
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Stick a fork what?
I can't!!
On your dresser.
Oh, sweetie, oh.
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Okay, London 1...
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Yummy noises.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Well... It's a date.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Did you find the dress?
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
Cups? You're giving me cups?
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
