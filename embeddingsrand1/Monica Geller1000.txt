No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
I guess that's how.
Oh no!!
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Why do I have to decide?
Bye!
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
What?!
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
I am so glad you said cooks.
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Okay, great!
What are you crazy?!
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
It's Fun Bobby.
Hey.
I'm sorry but...nothing.
What? I don't see anything.
Megan!
Yep, yep...You?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Ow!
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Yeah, me too.
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
What?!
You what?
Yes, they can stay with us.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
Just...please tell him.
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Hey.
Hi!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
You stole them from me!
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
You bought a boat?
Joey!
Game!
I'm a twinkie.
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Why would you do that?
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
What are you doing?
Wow! You are really fast!
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Okay great!
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
What?!
Really?
Oh, that's great!!
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
That's so gross!
Hey, you guys.
Michael.
Isn't this great?
Uh, Ross.
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
See he's nice. Right?
Of course.
Men are such idiots.
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh my God.
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
And I have costumes.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
What?
All right, what about the third guy?
Well, you're not.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Me and Chandler?!
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
Fine!
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Really?
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
She's bluffing!
All right.
Yes, you did!
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Ross, don't start.
Oh, I already have one.
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
What are you doing with the lamp?
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
So, did you do it?
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Okay, he's a senior in college.
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
That is so unfair!
Ok, then just go.
Yeah, so?
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
What? We could do it!
Bye!
Thank you.
Hi guys.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
We haven't eaten yet!
What if they don't?
...love you.
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
You look cute in bubbles.
A mirror?
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
You still have feelings for me don't you?
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Pretty much.
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Then why would he say it?
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
Hey.
Are you serious?
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Well, what am I going to say?
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
What are you doing?
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
That's a good call. Right.
Me going out with Richard's son.
Oh, no no no no no.
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Oh my God.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Are you through with that?
She lets you borrow them.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
So then you know?
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
No, here's your mail.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Yes!!
We do not have one of those signs.
Clogs.
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
Okay.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
I mean, was it Gina?
What did they do to you?
What?
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Yeah!
Okay.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Yeah, it did.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
I am loud!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
You love her!
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
All right, you're hired!
Bye sweetie, I love you.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Okay.
Yes!
Are you all right?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
You changed?
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Thank you.
Umm...
Wait, wait, wait!
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Phoebe!
Can you go any faster with that?
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Does it involve clogs?
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Hey.
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Joey, you had the night!
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
What are you doing?
You still work at the multiplex?
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
It is not over! You're over!
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Only here.
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
So, what's this.
Don't worry about it.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Oh my God!
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Oh crap!
Oww!
Why? Do you have a report due?
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Rachel!
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
I don't want a ghost.
Ohh!
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Done?
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
After the snap!
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Aren't you gonna...
Thank you. They're yours.
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
No, none at all.
Wow! It's small.
Well, thanks anyway.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Yeah baby!
Hey!
Ready!
I think she's here.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
It's nice.
How desperate am I?
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Am not!
Where have you been?
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
What are you trying on now?
No that's, that's okay.
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
Well, what did you do?
Worked like a charm.
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Yes.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
We are not going to whistle.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Well no, but um.
Really?
How are you doing?
What are you guys gonna do?
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
They've arrested Monica.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Hi!
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Oh, they-they sent me home.
Shhh!
Aww! I love you!
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Fifteen minutes.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Regular or decaf?
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Richard!
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Alright.
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
Would you just open it?
You're Lewis Posin.
Are these the shoes?
Okay, good luck!
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Please.
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
What?! You're going out with her again!
Hey.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
You came?!
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Oh my God!
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Burning's good.
Honey, there's a reason.
Hey guys! Hey!
Ow!!
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
How about, you're moving!!
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Why are so mad at him?
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
What's the part?
And you're cute too.
Cache? Jaunty?
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
It's that terrible?
Why not?
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Huh?
Oh that's so sweet.
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Joey!
What?
What is that?
Oh God.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Wow, is that Michelle?
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Nighty-nite.
No. See you don't understand.
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Do you love her?
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Hey!
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
I am good. I finished my book.
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
No, only because that's the graduation song.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
We're gonna see each other naked.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Yeah, right.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Hello, Chandler.
Good. What made you change your mind?
Okay...who are you?
Really?
What?
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
What is the worse part?
So to get this part you can't be?
Your favorite!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
So do them for free.
Chandler!
Where ya going?
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
You okay?
No, I haven't.
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Not any more!
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
What?!
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Uh-huh.
So! He'll understand!
Where were your parents?
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
I got you the foot massager.
Okay.
Hmm?
Oh no, wait! Joey!
Okay.
It's work.
You're not gonna mess it up.
Okay that does sound like fun.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Put your head back.
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Continue.
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Okay!
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Just go get some! Go!
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Wait, wait, wait!
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Have you found your dress yet?
I know! I know! I know!
How ya feelin'?
Hi.
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
What's wrong Phoebe?
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Hey.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Okay.
What's wrong with PBS?
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Bye.
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Fifteen minutes.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Yeah?
Between you and...
I'll pick it up for you!
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
Or incredibly offensive.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
This is so much fun!
Hey, I thought you already had one.
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
I've gotta get back in the game.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
She's right there.
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
Yeah!
Really?
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Are you okay?
How does she do that?
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
No it is not!
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Great.
Yes.
Yeah!
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Dead leg!!
You're a really good kisser.
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
"See you around?"
Please tell me it's his mother.
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
What?!
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Oh, sorry.
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Hello, people who do not live here.
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
Very!
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
1250.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
No, thank you.
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
And who pays for that?
No.
Hey.
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
The players.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
You really think that'll work?
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Hey there.
What else did you think about?
Of course!
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Well, apparently she does.
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Wait, he's not here yet.
Yeah!
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Sorry, Rach.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
All right, you!
Toothpick?
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Sure.
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Really, is he a swimmer?
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
What?
No, no, I don't.
I'm not your best friend?
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Oh... shoot.
I can't believe you let them win!
What?
Here, take a couple of these.
Come on!
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Why, how much is that?
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Look at you. All jealous.
Yes you did. Absolutely.
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Okay.
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
Really.
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
What is it hon?
Hi Chandler.
Hey, what's up?
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Ohhh, nice.
I can't believe you did that.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Our guy's a great dancer!
If you want, I'll do it.
Ohh.
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Okay. I can do that.
I thought you could use the help.
'Scuse us
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Wow, you worked in a mine?
Yeah.
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Yes, you did!
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
Oh, we have some...
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Why?
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
It's kind of an important one!
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
No-no-no! We need something old!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
What's the matter?
How much did ever really win before?
Bye.
Really? Your work laugh?
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
300 dollars?!
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
We're hanging out.
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Oh!
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
This was your idea?
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
You can not do this.
Hey!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Thank you.
Hey!
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
That is true.
Ok...ay.
Do you?
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
That doesn't seem fair.
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
I used to wet my bed.
Pick a number! That is your only job!
Honey, what's the matter?
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Oh May 15th.
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
You've never met Bob, have you?
What?!
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Joey, promise me something.
Thanks.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
Anything but stew.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
You need one too?
Oh.
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
That's because I'm in front of them.
Curry.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
What, he doesn't like Josh?
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Ohh, fun!
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
Maybe.
What?
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Now, open your eyes.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
5 6 7 8!
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Joey!
I'm just easing you in.
David who?
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Chasing him all around the room?
How was your first day?
It's Monica, open up!
Phoebe, tell her!
Uh-huh, that one!
What was that?
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
He is so amazing.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Then what's the problem?
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Mmm.
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
You're kidding?! That's great!
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
But you've only slept with two people.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
How?
All right, what's goin' on?
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Gimme 'em!
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Phoebe!
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Ahhh!!
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
No Phoebe I am mad!
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
How do you feel?
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Oh my God.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Hey sweetie.
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Hi.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Okay.
Ohh!
Go! Go! Go!
Okay..
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
C'mon!
He's retiling my floor.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Phoebe.
Hi!
What's this?
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Ross will do it.
What?
So you had fun, huh?
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
How about Mockolate mousse?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Yeah.
How much longer?
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Oh my God!
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Eh, you work for that.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You're welcome.
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
That's what you say about porn.
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Okay. Let's bring it in.
You dated her!
Okay.
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Why isn't it working out?
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Good night!
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Hang on a second I just got in.
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Does so count!
But my clothes are-ohh!
Oh, Chantal!
What do you mean?
This bicep?
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Hi.
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Oh no!
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Hi.
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Oh, yeah.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Hey, where is everybody?
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
I love you, too.
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Hi, nice to meet you!
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Oh, that's sounds great.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
Do you want me to pick you?!
C'mon up.
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
What's the charity?
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Hi, honey.
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Ohh.
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh my!!
In.
No.
Phoebe?
You're kidding!
Why not?
Nothing.
Really?
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
That's-that's not Phase Three.
What?
Aww, man!
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Give me that.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
That's your call.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
I wish all guys could be like him.
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
What?
What the hell are you doing?!
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Hey, how long are you in the city?
No he's not!
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
You really think this is okay?
Ah, the other Jack.
Once!!
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
She sent the chicken back again?!
Love is the best medicine.
Ready?
Okay!
You painting his toenails?
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Hello?
Mmmm! It's good!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
I'd do anything for you.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Okay.
What are you doing with those?!
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
He took off?
You start working on that list.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Oh...
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
