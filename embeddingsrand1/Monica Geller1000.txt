I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Okay, ready?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
What's a 'niffle'?
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
No, I really, really do.
I made them!
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Help yourself.
Oowww!!
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Hi!
Why?!
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Did she leave a number?
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
You'll vamp?!
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Hi.
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Okay. Umm...
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
It's Monica, open up!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
I love you.
Oh.
Of course.
Why?
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
The only problem!
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Yes!!
We have got to wash that!
She really left.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
I bet this will work!
We're switching rooms again.
You're his bitch.
There's an ad for a naked chef?
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Big time!
Hi Phoebe.
You love her!
I have not been sick in over three years!
Joey, this is you!
How are you doing?
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Well good, here let me help you out.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
It's hard for some people!
Hey!
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
That doesn't seem fair.
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I pick you, Phoebe.
Yeah, there you go!
No! Phoebe!
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
This is disgusting!
Hi!
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
The wedding starts at six.
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Does it involve clogs?
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Hi.
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
That's right.
Okay.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Break!
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
I was always Joanne.
I thought there wasn't a ball?
I-I-I think you look great.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Are you still awake?
Hi!
Hey!
Ross didn't scare you?
No.
Come on Ben.
You start working on that list.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Hi.
Rachel always cries!
Really?
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
Rachel locked the door.
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Yeah.
Why?!
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
Huh?
Thank you.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Uh-huh.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
So are you ok?
Oh, thank you!
You okay?
Please tell me you're stopping now.
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
What were you doing in Africa?
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Yes! Have you seen it?
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Oh, Larry.
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
You did a minute ago!
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Hey there.
Can you just hold on for one minute?
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Oh my God!
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Why do I have to decide?
Okay.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Because then I don't have to!
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Can I ask you a question?
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
I told you not to go down there!
I like that. What?
No because it-it didn't seem important.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Okay.
Chandler!!
Art it is.
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Why is it sick?
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Thanks.
You and me both.
You did not go!
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Why don't you just take it with you?
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Great!
Hey! Good, you're home!
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
And they weren't looking at you before?!
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
His indian name?
Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Jeffery.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Are you okay?
I'll do it!
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
So-so you would've just lied?
Oh yeah right!
Bye.
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
So what's Phoebe like?
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Because we won our apartment back!
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Hi.
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Yeah, well, is that better?
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
That's what it sounded like.
Anything larger back there?
Can you blame him?
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Hi!
Brides magazines?
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Why?
Phoebe that's crazy!
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Really?
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Well?
Do you love her?
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Hey.
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Hey!
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
No drops!
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Oh my God! You're water broke!
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Oh, this is so great.
I guess that's how.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Huh, wanna bet?
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Monica.
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
Why?
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
I know.
When did I sign for it?
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
No one.
Well, at least you scared someone.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
Really?!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
How? I don't have any money.
No.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Oh, you're kidding.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Hold on.
What?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Put your head back.
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
How did work go?
What does she mean by 'involved'?
I don't know.
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
That's true.
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Hey!
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
They tore it down a few days early.
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Oh God, yes!
No Phoebe I am mad!
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Uff.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
I was in too much pain.
Ten dollars an hour.
Let's do it!
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Joey, you don't have too!
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Hello.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Do you?
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Okay.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Hi.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
Okay.
Hey!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Was he crying?
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Brrrrrrr!
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Watch the thorns!
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Well no, but um.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
I can't promise anything.
You wanna get out of my face?
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
That is true.
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
We have one.
What about me?
I did.
Tell him.
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Yes that would be lovely.
Thanks.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Thank you.
Once!!
One!
Great...
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Yeah!
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
What are you talking about?
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Are you okay?
Oh...
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Look at this.
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Really?
You're gonna what?
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
What were we thinking?
Say you're sorry.
Did you go home and change?
Hey!
Yesss!!
That is never good.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Could you not look?
Where's that?
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Sit down.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Hmm.
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Bye.
Oh man! I did it again!
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
I know!
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Isn't that mine?
Bodington's!
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Hey.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Yeah!
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Hello, people who do not live here.
Why would you do that?
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Bye-bye.
What's the matter?
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Yes.
And well, what did she say?
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Umm, well, he's...
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Joey that is so sweet.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
OK.
In case it happens.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
We were just waxing our legs.
There's my little boy.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
What are you doing?!
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Yeah, no, me neither.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Okay.
And that would be?
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Was it...?
But, we pick again! We pick again!
How many fingers am I holding up?
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
How does she do that?
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Not even close.
Why, do you write him a lot?
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Yes.
Rachel's at work.
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Nothing.
I can't believe you bought this.
Hi, honey.
What?!
Oh, really?!
Hey! How was it?
Really?
I lost our mattresses.
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
I do not have baby fever!
I know!!
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Well, it's getting late.
What?
Huh?
I am 26.
Oh my God!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
I'm sorry but...nothing.
No.
You're not a senior?
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
I know why!
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Hey!
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Yes it's true.
We'll put buckles on it.
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
Shut up, and put my table back.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
You know Paul?
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Third door on the left.
I am the best.
What?! What are you doing?!
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
You said the baby.
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Don't you have to pee?
Well we... we kinda broke up.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Okay!
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Because the winner gets this!
Wow, you worked in a mine?
Aww, not right now.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
It's Fun Bobby.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
No, you?
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
All right, what's goin' on?
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Very good, so good.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
What about these? These look the same?
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
What? It's still going on.
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Oh that's great!
Joey!!
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Oh my Gosh!
This is my dress!
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
He hates to lose.
Yeah, that's a big step.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
You got a callback too didn't you?
Okay, here's your penis!
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
He's... our age.
Hey.
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Yeah, right.
Oh, I'm sorry.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
How's the big anniversary dinner?
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Me too.
Then what's the problem?
Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Hi.
I got you the foot massager.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Oh my God!
What did you tell them?
Oh, that is amazing!
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Hey! You're wearing pants!
What?
So how's it going with you guys?
Okay, come here!
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Oh... shoot.
I mean don't you trust her?
You bought a boat?
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Yeah, me too.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
Oh my God, Richard.
Ooh, nice.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
No.
Well put it back.
No.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
What?
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Okay.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Um-mm.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Me too!
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Wow!
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Sometimes we were.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Well you should be embarrassed.
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
It's uh...
I know I do.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Come on! I really need your help!
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Chandler what do you say?
Who did we fight in World War I?
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
But my clothes are-ohh!
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
I know!
It's Joey's birthday.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Ross, can I?
Please!
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Are you alone?
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
That's probably what they'll say.
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Stick out your tongue.
Changes?
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Phil!
It's like two miles!
I won the game.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
Quit flicking
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Still crying?
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Joey!
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Honey, we gotta go!
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
It is not over! You're over!
Oh no!!
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
He is right, isn't he?
No!
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Give me that.
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
What are you guys gonna do?
I'm getting married next!!
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Who is this?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
God, you are so strong.
Hi.
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Oh!
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
No.
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Really?
Who? Is that your sister?
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
What are you doing?
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Yeah, it's good.
But the mess!
All right, sorry.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Okay.
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Only here.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Ross!
So what did you do today Pete?
Really?
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Yeah!
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
There's a game?
Hi!
We're with you. We got it.
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Oh my God!
Clogs.
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
Take care.
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Really?
Well, not anymore.
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Come on!
Hi, nice to meet you!
Yeah.
Ross, thats my jacket.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
No, we don't.
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
I know.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
I was kidding.
Then what is it?
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
What did you say?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Have you seen Chandler?
Look!
Now, open your eyes.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
What?! What is it?!
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Actually, I did!
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Well then we still have a problem.
Yep, we wanna get married!
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
Hey, it's good to see you!
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
I swear you said you had the keys.
You don't have any stuff.
Hey, you guys!
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Yeah right.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
They really were pretty, weren't they?
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Bye.
God, look what I found in the drain.
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
Joey, do you work here?
He took off?
We should go.
I know!
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Come on, no peeking!
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Really?!
Let go!
I don't want a cat!
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Come on Rach, let's go.
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
"See you around?"
Oh, no no no no no.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Oh, thank you.
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Umm...
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
Do you know what's a bad idea?
He loves you.
Really?! You promise?
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Where's your bed?
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
So you didn't leave the bank?
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Really?
I got it!
Naked?
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
Why?
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
No, give me the...
Like a pirate?!
Oh, why?
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
What happened?
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
What's this?
Them?! Who's them?
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Who?
Yeah, yeah.
What?
There you go!
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
How, how did that happen?
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
And I would have to say pah-huh.
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Really?!
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Don't come in here!
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Why?!
So! He'll understand!
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
They were lovers.
Just mine?
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
It-it's so great to see you both here.
What took you so long?
300 dollars?!
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
What's that supposed to mean?
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
And Monica knows...
I hope she's OK.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
What?
I have no idea.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
So what're you gonna do?
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
So maybe we should just. . .
Chandler?
Huddle up.
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Michael.
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
What?
