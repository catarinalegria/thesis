I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Put your hands together.
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Oh my God!
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Half hour.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
Noooo!!
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Why not?!
Hey!
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
One.
You guys don't think I look 19?
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
Yes!!
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Hey! You ready to go?
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Woo-hoo!!
All right. I can't see.
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
Nope, not that one.
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Come on! Do something!
Hi, Rach.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Yeah?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
Won't-won't that take longer?
Okay!
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Hey.
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Oooh, what you got there?
Wow! Cool!
Hey, stripper!
You-you think?
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Sure. Yep.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Forget about it.
Hello New York!
We don't make enough fun of you already?
You don't say.
Oooooh!
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
I was thinking Chinese food.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
What a tool!
Yeah!
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
Yeah.
Is he gonna be ok?
Yeah!
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Sure, what do you want to see?
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
What are you doing?
Okay! All right!
Good morning.
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
At least I care about his feelings!
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Oh. Then, no.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
I'm him.
Hey.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Okay.
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Hey, what's up?
What's up?
Ok.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Well, I think we all learned something.
Oh, not my parrot.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Oh no, what happened?
What?
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Feminine.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Will you quit hoggin' it!
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
She's not even cold yet!
Ah, Kate?
Hey you guys.
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Something like that?
I went.
Yeah!!
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Good.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Who said it was for you?
Ross, you need some help?
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
That's right!
You look like a freak.
Okay.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Awwww!
What?!
Uh, moist, yeah.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
You got it! Oh-oh!
Hey!
What?!
What?!!
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Then why would you say that?!
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Thank God!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
What's this?
I guessed 20,000!
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
What?!
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
What?!
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
I guess.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Who's seven?
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
Hey.
What are you doing?
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Umm...
'Tonight' tonight?
Uhh, rub it?
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
And you'll be nice?
That's nice.
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
We all hate Emily!
Okay, you're on.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
My scones.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Well, I want it!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Good for you!!
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
Excellent.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Come on, quite yankin' me.
Thank you.
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Oh, OK.
I came over here to tell you guys.
Hey!
Hey.
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
I'm not sure.
No plans, huh?
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Ooooooh.
Thanks.
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Althea!
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Alrightalrightalright. There.
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
That makes more sense.
This is Janice.
But then you left.
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Hey, there's a dog out there!
Fine!
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
What?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
What's the matter with Rog?
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Yeah.
Six.
Goodnight.
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Y'miss it?
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
So, you're just Bing?
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Hey!
Did I say you could smell it?!
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Yeah, big stuff.
Ewwwww!
Which goes where?
All right, Ross!
Oh well then, good night!
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
Hello.
Well actually...
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
No. What?
Oh, well I'm uh...
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
What's up buddy?
You okay man?
What? What's wrong?
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
All right! You can have the chair.
Sorry.
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
C'mon, Ross!
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Has it been that long?!
When is she leaving?
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
No-o-o!!
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
Shut-out!!
Now she sounded breezy.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
Okay.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Hey Rach.
Hey! Any good mail?
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Sure! What's up?
Sure.
Ahhh...... Eh?
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Yeah. You okay?
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
What do you need?
What a bad idea!
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
Hey!
Because they wanted me to audition!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
With this ring? No contest.
Whadja think?
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
What up?!
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
I'll get it.
Why not?
You?
Damnit!
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
You could drink the fat.
So we are going on two?
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Uh, four.
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Hey.
Yeah baby!
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Hm-mmm.
Good enough to get fired.
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
It's not my first time.
That he doesn't exist.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
See you later, Gene.
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
No kiddin', hmm.
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Aww, there we go.
What-what-what is so funny?
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Y'know what?
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
Not so much.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
All right! So, was it amazing?
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
No-no, Kathy.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
