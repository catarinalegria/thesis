We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Never had that dream.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Gotcha.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Hey!
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Hi, how ya doing?
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Oh.
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Why, are you moving out?
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Okay that's fair.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
I found my identical hand twin!
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Hey.
That he doesn't exist.
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
What?!! That's even worse!!
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Yeah.
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
And of course, crotchless panties.
Unless what?
You just give him a spoon baby!
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Oh dear God!
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Not a problem.
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
You serious?
No.
Okay.
No!
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Open the box!!
Then you go to Tokyo.
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Then you do. Heh, heh.
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
How'd you get to that?
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Whatever.
Hey, all right!
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Of course I did.
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Cat.
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Hey!
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
But I'm the host!
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
Sorry Phoebe.
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
I got it.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Hey.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Hey now!
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Whoa!
Uhh, they're tall.
Have you been here all night?
I gotta go check something over here.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Okay.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Gotcha.
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
What?
They do!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
Hey Estelle, listen...
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Okay.
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
I was tired!
Oh.
Uhh do it?
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Really?
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
But it's dark out.
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Fine! Get out!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Why?
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
No, that means nothin to me.
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Fine.
Yes! Whew!
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Guess what?
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
What the hell is in there?
Eh, what are you gonna do?
So you uh, still wondering?
Die Hard 2.
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Oh no, what happened?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Hi!
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Well, what did you have?
Damnit Carl!
Hey.
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Come on man, you're not a potato.
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
What's the matter, Pheebs?
All right, huddle up, right over here.
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
Yeah.
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Oh my!
This will just be my batch.
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Yeah I did!
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Bwah-hah-hah!
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Hey you guys.
Hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
The Ross-Is that back?!!
What?!
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Hey.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
What?
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Hey!
I look more like him than you do!
I didn't get it?
Hola, amigos!
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Hey.
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
What?!?!
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Oh, not my parrot.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
What?
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
A two and a five.
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Ohhh!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Hey!
And you'll be topless?
Okay.
You got it.
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
You got that from what I said?!
Really? I don't...
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
No?
What?
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
What the heck is that?
What else?
Animals dressed as humans.
Very good! Okay. G.
Hey!
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
No.
I don't know! Charity?
Oh yeah?
Well, now we got a reason.
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
How can they do this to me?
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
You do?
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
No! Year! Happy No Year!
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Chandler, is that...
Rach, these are for you.
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Whoa!
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
Okay, take it easy.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Hey!
Yeah!
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
I don't know.
Hey!
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Hey, Kate!
Are you sure?
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Damnit!
Exactly.
The Ice Capades?
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Did you see the size of the closets?!
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
There was a seen in Footloose...
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Hey I-
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
We can't do that.
Ooh, that bad, huh?
In a minute!!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!

I don't feel like talkin.
Okay, you watch too much TV.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
No!
Oh, no!
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Hey!
Marcel?
Yeah, I know.
I guess I'm done.
I wanna gooooooo!
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
It's almost as if he knew.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
A little foos?
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Hey!
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Was the chord at least right...
Yeah?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
What's goin' on?
Can you tell me how this happened?
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Hey!
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Mmmm. Good.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Hi.
Wheel!
Exellent dream score.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
No-no.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
If you don't do it, I will.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
My scones.
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Are you going to do it?
What?
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
Peanut butter!
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Oh, I know...
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Hey, hey.
What is the big deal?
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
'My scones.'
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
If he goes first he can!
Hello, Zelda.
How you doin'?
Okay...
I went.
Chandler's wearing panties.
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Hey, you're not Kip!
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
So are guys doing okay?
Don't answer that.
Hey!
Do we need a cake?
Get out of here, really?!
Ohh!
That's a two line part.
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Yeah, you do!
I don't think so.
So you're the gynaecologist?
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
You?! And-and you?!
So where you gettin' it?
So what's it gonna be?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
She's not even cold yet!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Wait up!
The vicar!
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Yeah you did.
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Y'miss it?
No we weren't!
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Hmm, noodle soup.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
You got all that from the back of her head?
What?!!
G-sharp.
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
C'mon, she's your mom!
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
It certainly is a miracle.
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Hey Rach!
Well, I don't know!!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
What?
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Yeah, yeah he is.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
What?
How'd you get over that teacher?
What's going on?
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
I know!
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
No.
Yeah!
You and me, next dance?
What a phony.
Won't-won't that take longer?
Ross, you need some help?
You want his yearbook?
Yeah?!
But sadly I could not be enticed.
You're kidding!
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Good enough to get fired.
