Hey.
Should I not have told you?
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
What's block?
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
Which Richard?
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Where?
All right, and umm...
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Oh, I see.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
There you go.
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Happy birthday!
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Shut up!
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
But she just came up here!
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
That is damning evidence.
Thanks.
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Garfunkle.
It could be like a big giant guy.
I, umm, shut up!
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Chandler what are you doing?!
Ooohh, why?
He just got a divorce right?
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Yeah?
Hey.
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
I know.
It's Phoebe.
Hey!
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
I've had better.
Hey.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Oh! You got it?!
And chili!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
I don't know! I don't remember!
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Hey!
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Oh, right!
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Why?
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Which proves that I never lie.
Oh, okay.
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Oh, yeah, right.
Hey! What are you doing here?
All right, Joey, same question.
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Hey!
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
Okay... Okay.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
Oh. Hey!
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Yeah?
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Well, he didn't tell me.
Who, Josh?
Nah. Not really.
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Oh my God.
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
She is so great! I miss her.
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
I can't!!
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
My God! What did you order?!
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Remembered what?
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Okay.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
There he is!
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
OOooooo!
So how are things going with you?
Pastrami.
There it is!
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
So what's going on with you?
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
Please.
Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
Oh! You have a window!
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
So talk to her.
Okay.
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
Oh.
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
The end.
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
No listen to me! She is crazy!
Hi Emily!
Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Hi.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Oh, Chandler funny?
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Bye.
Hey.
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Alex Trebek?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Hello.
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Hi, so what happened?
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Really?
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Of course, yeah!
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Such a pig!
Well, if you think it will help.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Noooo!!
Well, it's better than us deciding.
Oh.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Oh, which museum?
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Wooo!! Hoo!!
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Nah-ha!
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Okay, they're just talking...
Thanks, Ross.
I don't think you mean that.
No, you?
Okay.
Hi!
Your mom was arrested?
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
On the touchy.
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
Yeah, you never heard of them?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Hey!
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
You can't give up on your dream.
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Oh my God!
I know what time you said.
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
OK Joey, your bet.
We're all right.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
Okay.
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Oh, en chante.
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
I don't use a curling iron.
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
We could have breakfast in bed...
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
In your atlas!
Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
No, but you can't.
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
So. You two are totally into each other.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Uh-huh.
Vince is a fireman.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Uh-huh, yeah!
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Wow!
Okay.
And why not?!
Yeah!
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Or you could end up with everything.
Yeah.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
What did he say?
...Then I've already seen this one!
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
So, here we are. Nervous?
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Hey!
Susan, he looks just like you.
Okay.
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
She wants to meet you in person.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
No! Ooh! Oh my god!
Oh.
May I ask why?
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
Alright, whadyou do with him?
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Already?!
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
So?
Hi!
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
See, I didn't know that.
Yes! .... or no.
Nothing-Why?!
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
My roommate.
Yeah, welcome.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
What?
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Really?!
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
A birthday party.
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
So, I'm here, ready to play.
Rachel?
Open it up, let me see.
Umm, a flea market?
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Wow, cute one!
Okay then.
No! I do want to!
Good one! Yeah.
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Oh.
Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
What? What?
Hi.
Does Joey have any idea?
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Ohh, ohh.
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Yeah.
I've never done that.
Ewww!
I know where Minsk is.
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Why?
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
Just, you know, to see... um.
Yeah me too.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
You won't let go?
I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Okay. Bye!
Didn't you sleep together?
I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
This stuff is great!
Ohhh, wow.
Oh don't do that.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Oh, give it to me.
Hey.
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
What?
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
What else?
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Oh, yeah!
Sir! No sir!
Mr. President.
Hi Paul!
What was that?
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
And a small piece of chocolate.
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.

Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
John?
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Now what is Fabutec?
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Ehh!!
Not yet, no.
Ooh, now you lost me.
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.

Me too! So happy for them!
My Saturn dealership.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
Oh my God Monica!
What?
You told them he was missing?
Okay, um, stay.
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
That game should not be played without my supervision.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
