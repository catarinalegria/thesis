I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Okay.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
What is it?
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
I think it's important that you do.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
Do the claws again.
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Why? What happened now?
I might have.
Hey!
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
I don't think you mean that.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
And do you know what girls are really good at?
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Okay, there.
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
Oh yeah, like you never called!
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
On the touchy.
Yes, but I'm doing this.
Do it do it do it!
OK, is this really my father?
Well, it felt French.
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Oh, hey!
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Get in here!!!
Hi.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Yeah.
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Oh!
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Have you seen your guy's body?
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
With what?
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Well then, you should look with us.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
My guy is well read.
Oh.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
What?
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
God!
Thanks.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Don't get me started on that.
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Oh, I can still do that.
Saved your ass.
He's so funny!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
London is stupid! Stupid!
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Oh hi!
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
What?!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
Oh my God! How bad was it?
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
Going to the hospital tonight?
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Or not, whatever.
Oh! Oh my God!
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Well, we should go.
Oh man.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Ahh.
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Yeah, me either.
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Shiny.
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
You said I was boring--Ohh!
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
So did you ask him?
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
What umm, what happened?
Yeah! You're the best!
Oh, was I doing it again?
Come on, like you never talk that.
Oops!
Oh, my, oh!
Okay, listen Robert...
Hey, what's going on?
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Hi!
I do too.
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Hey.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
My guy has great teeth!
Huh!
Oh, really?
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Hey.
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Ross?!
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
A chin dimple!
Well, actually it's just from me.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
On a totally different bet.
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Left! Thank you.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Well, he made a move on me.
What?
Okay.
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Ooh.
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Joey!
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Sure.
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
Can you hear anything?
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
So, I'm here, ready to play.
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
No, just a barrel.
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
Ew-eww!! Undies!
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Wow. Thank you.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Great! Thank you very much.
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Ick, you were eavesdropping.
Are you crazy?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
What else do they add smell too?
Hi!
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
How do you know about this?
No.
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
What?
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
What I said you had...
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Yeah, I've been around.
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
You're welcome.
We're all right.
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
She wasn't a hooker.
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
All right, you know Paolo?
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
Oh, hello liar.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Hey!
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Because I think it means more to you.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
Bye, good luck.
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Oh yeah.
Hi.
Yeah!
I know. They were mine.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Give it.
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
Uh-huh.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
leave...
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Oh my God!
Huh.
I can do that.
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
No, 'cause he's yummy.
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Still.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Great.
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Ok.
Go for it.
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Ooh! Hi!
I think she's OK.
Thank you so much.
Really?! Really?!
Ah!!
Oh, I see.
Fine!
Yay me.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Ohh.
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
I know!
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Yeah.
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
I don't know.
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
So what are they doing?
Does it look like an ashtray?
No.
Hey!
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Hey.
Remembered what?
How do you feel?
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
You! An actor?! That's madness!
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Huuh.
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
This stuff is great!
Much as you are.
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
Uh-huh.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
And call me!
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Yes! Oh no!
Hey!
Yeah!
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Hey! Ross!
No, answer his.
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Oh. What's a lurker?
Hi!
Let's run towards them!
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Oh, is the play over?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
The movie?
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
I had one.
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
I love Jacques Cousteau!
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
What?
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
No.
Um, cake.
Hi...
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Hey Ryan, what's up?
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Yeah, coffeehouse.
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
Well, then...Let's.
Ooh! Brian's Song!
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
That's a bird?
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
How close?
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Umm, yeah! Today's.
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Hey!
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
So? Did you get the annulment?
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
Mmmm hmmm.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Okay, bye.
You make up songs?
Yes! She's very excited about that.
Heh?
Ok, thanks.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Where's Chandler?
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Oh my God!
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
And we did.
Enh. Sure!
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Oh my God!
Yeah.
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Gary.
Hey.
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
So how long have you known?
Yeah?
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
Okay.
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Garfunkle.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
No.
And, and!
Well, what did he do?
What? Oh my God!
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Yeah, welcome.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
I'm having another heart attack!
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Ohh, get a room.
Hi.
Then change it back!
Hi, guys.
What?
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
I'm sorry.
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Oh! No problem! I...
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
I don't use a curling iron.
Sells drugs to kids.
Yes, I will tell her.
Okay, who's next?
What's a Movement class?
He just got a divorce right?
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
Good idea!
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
I think she would like that.
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
Joey.
What?
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Wow, cute one!
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Really?
But we have to!
Oh, what? What was it?
Feel better?
All right, the seven of us miss you.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
It's so good. Oh, thanks.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Say we are unagi!
I got it.
Bye.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Me too. Rachel.
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
Yeah?
Oh don't do that.
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Yeah.
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
What?!
Nothing, nothing.
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
You guys. You suck too.
