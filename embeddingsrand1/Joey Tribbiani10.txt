All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
Hey now!
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
That's what you told me.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
