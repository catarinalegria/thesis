Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
What?! What the hell?!
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Hey.
Him? Him, Ross?
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
What makes it pilgrim?
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Oh, they love your casserole.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Good choice.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
I know what time you said.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Are you the cutest?
Yeah?
I stepped in something icky.
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Okay.
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Well then definately don't take his name.
All right, so what were you thinking?
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
Maybe on some level.
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
Yeah, I've been around.
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Well, I can't help you.
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
Oh.
What is that?
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Oh God!
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Oh my God!
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
She is so great! I miss her.
Huh?
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
DANGER!!!!!
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
Hey!
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
Okay... Okay.
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Oh, just ask him!
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
Oh, I'd like that.
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
I see.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
Ok. One.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Hi!
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Really?
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Okay?
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
You're right.
Hi!
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Well, what did he do?
How much was it?
Rachel?
Oh, then no.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
OK, is this really my father?
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
And call me!
Hey!
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
No-no! I-I...I found one.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Yeah, he's gotta go.
Oh.
To Ross.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Well, I think I can help you get over him.
So you do know who he is! Sorry.
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Hey!
Yes, you're having a boy!
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
Rachel said that!
But you guys came so close.
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
John Glenn is here?!
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Oh, hello liar.
So tell me about this girl?
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
Oh, ok bye-bye.
So, did you pick one yet?
Hey!
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Oh yeah, come here.
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Oh, the Olympics.
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Hey.
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Hey!
Uh-huh.
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
What?
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Fine. All right, fine.
Hi.
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Oh yeah, like you never called!
Sure
Where were you?
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
Ok.
You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
I-We gotta get Monica.
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
Why?
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Come in.
Ohh!
It's nice that he has someone.
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Ok, I'll walk you out.
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Uh-huh!
Bye!
Yeah! What are you saying?
John?
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
Yeah.
