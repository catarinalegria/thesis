Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
All right, I'm sorry.
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Oh my God!
Oh my God.
I'll have coffee.
Ew-eww!! Undies!
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Fine! Be murky!
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
No.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Congratulations!
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Yeah?
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
And call me!
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
What are you gonna do?
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
We want you to marry her!
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
I'm gonna get coffee.
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Say we are unagi!
Are you still mad at us?
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Oh my God. What happened?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Yeah.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Okay.
Hey!
Yes! She's very excited about that.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Why? Why would you do that?
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
Hey.
Oh yeah, right now.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Rachel.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
She's a waitress.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
I would love that job!
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Hey!
What?!
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
Okay then.
Oh no, how?
You guuuyys.
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK.
So.
Oh no no.
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
I am.
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Okay, let's talk outside.
Hellooo!
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
No thanks, I've already seen one.
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
Yeah.
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
No, not the used wax.
Oh, like that's a word.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
All right, that's it, I quit.
Nooo! Why would you think that?
Ok, do you know A minor?
Okay! Okay! Okay!
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Oh my God.
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Ooh, now you lost me.
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Yay, I rock.
Happy birthday!
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
You too!
Ross!
What was that?
Sure.
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
I-I-I found it interesting.
Oh, then no.
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Fine, I'll go call her.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Ok. One.
Not after this!
Thank you.
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Great!
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
Janice? You called Janice?
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
Okay.
What?
But Mon, you have to get our money!
If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Hey!
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Monica!
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
We have good news, look whose back!
Oh.
Ohh, uh-huh so much!
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Marcia and Chester.
Paul.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
Yeah well, we'll see.
Ooh.
Oh.
Hey!
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Yeah, maybe.
Yummy noises.
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Hi Paul!
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
Hello.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
What were you modeling for?
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Yeah! You're the best!
Okay.
Yeah that's better than my way.
Aww, good. What?
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Yeah.
Do you want a refill?
