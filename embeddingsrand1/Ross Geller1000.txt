All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
What? That's like insanely easy!
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
I'm going to the bathroom.
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
That's it, your doing great.
I don't know if it's true.
Hopefully.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Still?!
Yes, we have to tell her!
Well, hello Rachel!
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Done!
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
They're not listening too me?
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
That's right! Wait no, Ben.
So this is your office?
Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
How are you?
Pheebs, what about you?
What?
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
I know.
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
I was not!
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
There we go. All better.
She was...
No!
What?
Hey!
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
No.
Chloe? Hi..
Hi.
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
What?! Why?!
Hi!
What kind of problem?
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Oww!
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Just a smidge.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Hey!
What's up with the greed Joe?
Us too.
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
Rachel...
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
No-o-o! No way!
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Come on, let's go!
All right, here's the ring.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
So umm, any word from Susan?
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
C'mon, tell us.
What?
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Wait! It was my plan.
No.
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
Thank you.
Yeah.
Come on, two on one.
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Umm, no.
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
It's okay. Come, come on in.
How much did you pay for that?
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Yeah. So...
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Oh God, no.
Hey!
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
Eh, no problem.
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Uhh, those are tacos.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
It's breast milk.
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Yes! Santa's coming!
Huh?
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
I don't know.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
You like it?
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
OK.
No, 19.
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
Uh, hello!
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
What?
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Easy.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
What are you guys doing later?
Yeah, well...nah.
I don't see why not.
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
I don't know Rachel, why?
Okay.
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
That was good.
What?
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Then where the hell have you been?!
Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Hey!
Thank you.
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
Just uh, brought back your videos.
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Yeah.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Okay.
Hey!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Monica. Whaddya think?
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Hey?
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Lemme see.
Can't do it, can you?
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Yeah, well...
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Nope! Something else.
Yeah?
Why aren't you guys dressed?
Hi.
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
To wear in front of people?
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Oh, that's great, that is great!
What?
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
And thank you, for that.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
We have got to start locking that door!
And that's, that's funny why?
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Yep.
Yes, yes, that's right...
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
OK, now, sit. OK.
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Yeah.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Right?
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Whoa! You had sex today?
Rach!
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Dude, we got to talk.
Over here.
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Obviously not to Joey.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Was I talking to her about gas?
Hmm-Hmm.
Yeah.
Right?
Yes, tell me.
Oh God.
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
Help!
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Ahhhh!!
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Pheebs...
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Dude, what am I gonna...
Hey!
I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
I, Ross...
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
Come on! Here.
Thank you, thank you.
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Try the bottom one.
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Ohh, what's wrong?!
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Huh...
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
That's not bad.
Tho?
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
What?
So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Is that so?
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
What?!
No, 10 is the highest.
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Yeah?
I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
Argh!
Is this what you had in mind?
No! Why?
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
Phoebe!
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Yeah, okay.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
No.
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Aw, right.
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Bye Ryan.
What are you, what are you doing?
That only took me an hour.
Hi!
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
I will give you a call.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Oh, aaaah!
No.
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Yeah!!
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Yeah, I'll take some.
Thanks, man, big help.
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
No! No we don't!
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Dude, what are you doing?
Awww, man! Really?
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
You wanna buy a car?
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Naked friends.
What?
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Yeah.
Like what?
Neither will I.
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Yeah, it really was!
Uh... to the bathroom.
Let me see! Show them!
OK, tip the man.
Same difference.
Uh, just a sec dad. OK, be cool, just be cool. OK dad.
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Well thanks!
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Susan Sarandon.
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Okay, I think I got it.
I gotta get to work.
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
I am, uh, I am...
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Oh.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
It's my joke.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
What happened?
Not just restaurants, from our house.
So what do you want me to do?
No.
Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.
Gas? Wow! Intense.
A basket of mini-muffins.
It's not like we don't know how to party!!
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
Right.
Mon?
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
I'm gonna be on TV!!
Hey roomies!
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Come on, don't do this.
There's an image.
Okay.
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
I got it.
Sure. Why not?
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
C'mon Rachel.
Hm-mmm.
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
How are you ever going to sell this place?
Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Really?
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Pass it! Pass it!
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
I am now.
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Rings?
Hey!
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
I don't know.
That is one good looking man!
Dude, we were good!
Okay.
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Yeah.
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
You tell them to wait!
Hey! Everyone.
Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Uh, I don't know, whatever.
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Yeah?
What kind of research?
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
Yeah!!!
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Hey!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
All right, try pedaling.
Then what am I supposed to do?
Bye.
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
What?
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
What?
His daughter was hot.
What do you think you're doing?!
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
You think?
I know.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
And it can't be Joey.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Hi!
Goodnight.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Hey, you wet my pants!
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
What? What's on your shoulder?
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
No, they're not.
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Oh, right!
Well, uh.
Excuse me?
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Is that Mark?
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Is this about Mark?
Hi. She said yes.
In the bank.
No.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Hey! You were so right!
Turn.
No.
Only way to fly.
That's correct. Ladies?
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
Oh, now you want a favour?
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Okay!
Hi.
I'm still hungry!
The big book of childrens' names.
It's not a club.
Good.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Hey!
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Sorry.
And that's funny, why?
How could I forget?
Hi Jill!
Yeah!
What?!
Oh, we just...
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
What's that on the bottom?
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Cassie?!
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Get out.
No-no-no-no-no.
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
Fighting?!
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Here you go.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Oh yeah!
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
You don't believe in evolution?
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
Rach, have you never done this before?
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Yes. Yes I do.
All right.
Are you kidding?!
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Oh.
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Breathe.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Why?!
Oh, you're...
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Then you are neither of your parents!
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
I get it! Well, that's that.
The actress!
You'd wait?
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
I hope Ben has a little sister.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
hey, fella! How you doing?
What?!
Alright.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
Thank you.
Mmmm.
Hi.
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Okay, I'm the baby.
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Well..
Hey, where's Chandler?
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
What are you talking about?
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Sorry.
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Ok.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
What? What?
You got ink on your lip.
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Hey!
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Hi Gunther.
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Oh, thanks!
What are you talking about?
Hey.
Okay.
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Okay, okay, okay.
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Doorknob! Doorknob!
We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Now she's passed.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Huh?
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
Hey, do you have any gum?
Ok.
Yeah!
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Are you sure?
What do you mean?
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
That is an old, Chinese woman!
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.
Hi!
So, what's going on now?
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
Good for you.
Pregnant?!
Hi.
No. It's the one he's licking.
What time?
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
Yeah!
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Bye Ben.
Right.
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Great to see you!
So, uh, how's she doing?
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Sure! Here.
I-I, did that for you.
Are you serious?!
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Well y'know 'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Technically, huh, no.
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
The button, the button.
Hello!
I'm reading your ad.
Hey!
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Uh fellas,
Um, no.
Is that supposed to be an insult?
Look, look, look.
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
It's not a library...
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
You're gonna be an aunt.
Huh? Oh, I got this--this!
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
What?
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Are you jealous?
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Ok, Mom never hit.
Yeah.
Ohh.
Eh? We'll show him!
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
All right. Okay, here we go!
Show me where?
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
You were trying to eat it!
Got me.
Yeah?
Ohh.
Hello?
Hi, Pheebs!
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
And that's not against your oath?!

Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
One more day, seriously/
Oh, come on!
Hey, what's this?!
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
What the? What...
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
Ahh, no, I'm good.
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Hey!
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Really?
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Found it.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
What? No-no, a lurker.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
She's talking.
I'm just trying to help you, move on.
What's the part, Anti-man?
Hey!
Joey?!
I want to go to the bathroom.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Yes, you can, very much.
Me too!
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Why would I tell him?
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Challenge excepted.
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
Let's show 'em.
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
There's other stuff too.
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
I'm not going to do that.
No.
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Oh no-no-no!
Excuse me?
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Hey!
Okay, I gotta go.
Got it!
Hey.
What?
What am I going to do?
Wow, Rhonda.
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Until we start to look very small.
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
You got a tattoo?
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
I could ask her to live with me!
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
You ah, wanted to see me?
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
I'm gonna call after you!
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
In this life, Phoebe.
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Play it.
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
Oh, I'm sure.
Was your basket on top?
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
No!
Argue with that.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Hello.
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
You should get some sleep.
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Carol?
Thank you.
Does it always, uh--?
Hi honey, how did it go?
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
For real?
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Before the snap!
And you didn't marry him because...?
Hey, honey.
And here's little Ben nodding off...
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
Hi, is Rachel there?
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Ni-chou chi-ma!
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
Hey, thanks Rach.
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
Hey Rach!
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Breathe.
Nuh-uh.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
That's who.
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
Yeah.
What am I doing?
Well, now I do!!
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
All right.
What?
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Twice.
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
What thing?
Hey!
Uh-huh.
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Okay, it must just be me then.
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Hey, Pheebs.
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Hi, honey.
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Well, last weekend...
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
Hey.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
We fell asleep! That is all.
I, er...
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Yeah!!
So, uh, he's back.
You can have the last piece, if you want.
Hey.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Give me two.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
All right, see you guys.
Hi.
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
I'm in for fifty cents.
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Come on, seriously.
Hello.
Hi.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
