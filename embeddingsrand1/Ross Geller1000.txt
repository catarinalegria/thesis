Twice.
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
I love you.
I want my turkey now!
Yeah! Got it!
OH...MY...GOD!!
Why did you do that?
ON A CAT??!!!!
Who's drink can I freshen?
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
I just wanna check something.
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
From you? Yes, please!
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
Come on, show them to me.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
You really serve people sneezers?

Hey!
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah.
Huh.
Phoebe!
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Yeah.
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Okay. Hut! Hike!
Ohh, I don't think so.
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Rach! Rach!
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
When?
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
Thanks.
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Hello.
Great, how did it go?
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Hey!
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
What? Is it the comet?
The physical act of love.
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Man! They cannot get enough!
So what are you gonna do?
Any time.
That's not bad.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Chandler-
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
Yep?
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
Okay. So we're, we're good?
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Challenge excepted.
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Oh, no!
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
So?
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
So were you in Nam?
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
I know.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
What?
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
No.
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
I'm gonna be on TV!!
What-what is it?!
Guess who?
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
I, er...
But...
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Ah, I'm sorry.
Oh.
Hey!
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
Im gonna be a father.
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
I could, yeah, I can do that.
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
What?
An egg?
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
The Geller Cup.
Oh my God, you guys!!
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Hi.
Yeah.
I'll take sports.
It was my first time.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
I am dressed.
Umm?
Like buddies.
Hey!
What's going on?! That's what's going on!!
2:17.
I am gonna see her again.
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
I know.
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
Wow!
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
So what, we just sit?
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
We uh, we just cooked it up.
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
Oh.
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
Rach, he's not an ex-con.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
All right! I want my key back!
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
Hey! Hi Bonnie!
What?
Oh.
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
What?
Hi there!
Oh my God. I mean...
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Okay.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Huh.
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
You really didn't know?
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Do not give him any money!
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Yeah.
No! No!
Yes it is. See.
All right. Feel good?
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
Yeah. Right.
Ross, wants a pajmena?
Marcel! What've you done to him?
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Right.
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Save it.
That's, that's nice twice!
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
I would say that.
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Hi.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Sure. Why not?
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
this summer?
Okay.
Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
I have an oily T-zone!
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Petty...
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
Thanks.
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Mmm.
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Thanks Rach.
Yeah, well...nah.
Why did you hate me?
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Am I?!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Ohhhh...
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Hi!
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Hi, Mrs. Green.
How we doing, you guys ready?
No no, that's me.
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Excuse me?
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Shut-out!!
How are you?
Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
I-I, did that for you.
Come on. All right, here we go. All right?
I know.
Hi Gunther.
Okay, good bye!
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
I know.
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Well..
She, she was different.
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
People can hear you.
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
Really.
I know.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
I think he can be.
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Hey!
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Hey, come on in.
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
In the bank.
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
Are you serious?
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Give me two.
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
Sure. I'll help you.
Who needs a lease when it's family!
Huh.
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
What?
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
When did I say you were boring?!
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
What?!
Yeah.
Happy to.
Are you sure?
Hey!
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
Breathe.
Le Poo's still alive?!
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
Yeah.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
I just asked that girl out.
Yeah! Rach?
Yeah.
Hey Chandler. Monica!
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
There we go. All better.
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Hey!
That is one good looking man!
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Okay. Cool.
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Oh really! Why is that?
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Again, it's not that he...
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Ugh.
Not at the concert.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Sorry-sorry Jill.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Hey Mon.
Oh.
Okay, quick and painful.
Hello? Hi.
Hi!
You're kid's name is Raymond!
There was no song. There was no song!
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
All right, try pedaling.
What are you doing?
73! 72! 71!
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Hey roomies!
There he is!!
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
Doctor Burke is sexy?
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
He finally asked you out?
What thing?
You had fantasies about Emily?
Step back.
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Yes! Please!
You okay?
Emily.
Totally!
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
You mean, we-you and me?
Okay. This stuff?
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Well umm...
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Huh?
Wow! What a pleasure.
Yeah.
Ok.
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Wait a minute, look.
You're bleeding.
They published my paper.
Happy birthday!!!
All right.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Umm, no.
Yeah.
Okay, okay, okay.
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Hey, where'd you get that?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Hey, what's this?!
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Did you really hear a bear?
Mi-mi-mii.
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Hi!
Ok, here, here. There we go.
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
He left that.
Thank you.
Hey!
Yes. Yes I do.
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Ohh!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Hey, someone order a coat?
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
It's my joke.
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
Must pee.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
That's closer.
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
I didn't get the annulment.
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
I am a good kisser.
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Hello.
In your mouth?!
Right?
Yeah alright.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Hello?
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
That's it, your doing great.
Hi!
I-I-am-
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
What?
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Really?! We are?
Hey guys.
But, you are.
Yeah.
Rach!
...But a man can change.
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
What, now?
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
What?!!!
What?
Pepper?
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
...everyone, this is Chandler!
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Oh, please...
He does not look happy.
But...
Hey! What's up?
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
I think just the annulment for today.
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
Oh, forget it, okay?
What are you doing?
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
A date.
Ooohhhh!!
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
Whip it out, whip it out.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Yeah.
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
I know.
Dude!
Can't we just use a pen?
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Wow!
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
I could ask her to live with me!
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
That's right! Wait no, Ben.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
Juice, I need...
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Chandler's gone again!
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
I know!
It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Sorry.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
So how'd it go?
Thank you.
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
Ahhhh!!
Mon, look who I ran into!
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
...and I really think it should be me.
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
I do.
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Why- why are you here, Carol?
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
You're right!
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Mmm-Hmm.
Yeah, I'll take some.
What?
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
You complete me kitchen, matey!
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
We can't do it again.
...Now that was fun.
Hey guys!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
Hello! Hello!
Get out!
Pheebs...
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Rach.
Mmm hmmm.
What was, what was that?
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
Why aren't you guys dressed?
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
You got it.
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
You can live with me.
How is that important?
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Okay.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Yeah!
Then what am I supposed to do?
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Mon.
Yeah, right.
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
Oh-ho, okay.
Oh, I'll have some!
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
What?
Hey!
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Open up. We want to talk to you.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
That was 14 hours ago.
Go Joe!!!
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Well, yeah!
You got me.
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
Oh, no, no.
My hands?
What's with her?
Gas? Wow! Intense.
Yeah.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Oh, I am very in.
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
Yeah?
C'mon kid, let's go.
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Hey, Mon.
Huh.
Sure.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
No, you let me fini...
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Number six: the way you smell.
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Oke-dokey.
Uh-huh.
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Good, so do I
Hey
Hmm?
Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
Well...
Naa.
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
I don't know Rachel, why?
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
You remember Janice, right?
Wow! I could've died tonight.
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Hey!
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
No thank you for... Thank you.
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Mm-Hmm.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Yes, I did.
What? You have a date? Who with?
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Okay.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Die Hard!!!!!!
Us too.
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
Really?
Uh-hmm.
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
What?
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Mon?
Yeah, I think she looks good.
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Hey.
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
All right, here's the ring.
Oh, that's me.
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
I missed you too.
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Yes, of course they like you!
What?
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
I-I-I...
That bitch!
Hi!
Ross.
Awwww!!!
We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
Show them to me!
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
And somebody took a shot at me!
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Why, why, why would you dream that?
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Hi.
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Oh my god.
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Good call!
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Are you not seeing him anymore?
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
You know what I like most about him, though?
That's right!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
I know.
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Excellent!
This is-you-
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hey!
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
No! No! No!
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
What?!
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
I think we proved our point.
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Rings?
Are you sure?
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
All right. Okay, here we go!
Oh-ooh!
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
No.
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
No.
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
I like this song.
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Toilet paper?
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
He didn't get the goggles!
Okay, it's not, it's not.
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Dude! That's my sister!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
'Scuse us
Could you be less enthused?
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Bye.
I don't know what to say.
Hey!
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Joey, please.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Hey.
Well, uh.
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
Okay.
Okay, see ya later.
Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
You got me a cola drink?
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Congratulations.
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Hey! What's up?
Cat.
Okay.
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Hey guys.
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
So?
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
What?
I'm sorry.
Who?
No!
What's the part, Anti-man?
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Actually, no, we're not.
Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Now she's passed.
You got a tattoo?
No.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
Nono, that would be me again.
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Two seconds...
I'll get it! I will get that!
I'm never gonna find love again.
Oh my God!
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
How you doing?
Ohh! That would be great.
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
At the coffeehouse, right.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
What?
Howard?
I don't know.
You want me to call her right now?
Let's give it a shot.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
Oh my God. Congratulations.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
So what's it shaped like?
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
You bug me.
Great!
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
What? No-no, a lurker.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Divorced men's club.
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
What's going on?
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
I don't know. Soap?
Hi.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Aw, Mom...
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
Okay, let's go!
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
She's not Rachel.
Yes but too me he's just, man.
Ohh...
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Something about hi.
All right, maybe it means that too...
Yeah!!
Oh-oh, absolutely!
About what?
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Yeah! Got it!
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
Hi.
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.

Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.

Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
No, not a problem.
You should get some sleep.
Hey Rachel.
Monica did it?
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Well, I guess that's it.
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Alright...

Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
Phoebe? Phoebe?
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Awww.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
So we're a little late.
