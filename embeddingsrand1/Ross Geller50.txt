I don't know, umm...
Why did you hate me?
Okay, let's go!
In the death seat?!!
Hey!
Hey!
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Yeah. Right.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Okay!! Okay!!
You're right!
Not yet.
Bye Ben.
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
God no!
Mmm-Hmm.
Whip it out, whip it out.
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
All right, gentlemen, you're up first.
Are you serious?!
What?
What?
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
And it can't be Joey.
Why, why, why would you dream that?
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
Who?
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Monica!
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Yeah.
Yay!!
Oh my God, you guys!!
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
No-o-o! No way!
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Huh?
Okay, it must just be me then.
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
That's, that's funny. Change!
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
