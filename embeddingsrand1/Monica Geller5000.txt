Oh, we have some...
Yes? ..yes, she is.
What are you doing?
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
What's that supposed to mean?
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Oh, I think so.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Mmmm! It's good!
Come on!
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
That'll work!
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
No, I haven't.
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
No time for that!
Yeah, you should.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Or Spin the Bottle?
I know! I know.
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
A small puff of air, now come on!
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Do I know you?
Really?!
Nah, I got it.
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
What?!
The Richard.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
That's your call.
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
I love you.
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Brrrrrrr!
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
I am not.
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Well, who's voice was that?
No!!
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Come on Ben.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
What's the charity?
Well, no. But...
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Don't worry about it.
Hey!
Oh yeah.
He asked you out?!
Hey.
Please!
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
No one.
This was your idea?
You have other friends?
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
How's it going with her?
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Maybe.
I called him.
So what did you do today Pete?
Don't say it!
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
And six others.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Yes.
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
I bet this will work!
Thunder being stolen!!
What?
Hi, Chandler.
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Oh.
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
How, how did that happen?
'Cause you invited your assistant.
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Yep! And lot's of it!
No.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
Okay, he's a senior in college.
Give me that.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
He didn't ask me to marry him.
What-what are you doing?
Makes me wanna puke!
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Isn't that mine?
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
dammit!
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Weren't you nine?!
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Bodington's!
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Yes!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
You're welcome.
Thank you!
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
What?!
There's our star!
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
What are you talking about?
Hi.
The players.
Everybody knows!
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Hey, you guys!
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
No that's, that's okay.
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
We're switching rooms again.
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
Yes!
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
What's up?
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Excellent!
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
Hey.
Oh gosh.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Ennnh.
I hate men! I hate men!
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
Really?
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Phoebe, wait a minute!
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Chandler!
So you watched the movies huh?
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
All right, sorry.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
What? It's still going on.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
What're you gonna do?
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Or 45.
We're so sorry.
Subtle guys!
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Ok.
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Will you stop!
I so wanna be attracted to you.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Well put it back.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Okay fine, now Ross...
OK, um. Goodbye.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
So it's okay to date a student.
Just some stuff for the party.
That was a half an hour?
Claws?!
What?
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
We should go.
I'm sorry.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Oh no!!
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Yes! Have you seen it?
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
I understand.
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
I don't know.
So-so there is no party.
What do you mean?
There's more beer, right?
Oh.
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Oh, look, he's waking up!
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Unless...
Yeah.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
I can't do it!
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
What?
Losers walk!
I just asked you.
Woo-woo!
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Chasing him all around the room?
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Why, do you write him a lot?
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Oh my God!
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Now?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Chandler!
Paul!
Okay.
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Yes!
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Because they made me.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
That's okay.
Okay, in we go.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
Are you okay?
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
What are you talking about?
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Awwwww...
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
I'm sorry honey.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Alright.
Okay. I-I can't watch.
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Alright, alright, alright...
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
I made them!
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
He is right, isn't he?
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Duh-huh!
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Hi Steve!
Joey!!
No.
You're kidding?! That's great!
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
Even with me?
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Really?!
No, no, I don't.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
You flicked me first.
Ooh, nice.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Hah!
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Nice.
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
Hey!
Okay great!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Oh.
Hmm, bite me.
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
We have a ladle.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Oh, they-they sent me home.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Me too.
Okay that does sound like fun.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
I really need to talk to you.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Oh, that's nice!
You're not gonna be phased out!
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Oh, no...
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Including me?
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Phoebe!
Thank you.
Ready!
They have racquets don't they?!
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Just come.
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Yeah?
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Hey, aren't you up next?
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
Chandler.
No, she's out shopping.
No!
Okay..
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
You're going to China?
What's hard to believe?
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Hi.
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
Really?
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
I'll be right back.
Okay.
What?
Why?
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Yes!
Wow, you worked in a mine?
I'm just trying to spice it up!
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Ross, don't start.
What?
That is sooo not true!
To the bank.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Hey there.
Burning's good.
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
I'm outa here.
Woo-hoo, geeek!
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
Whaaat!
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Them?! Who's them?
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Continue.
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Hey, I know I what I want!
I'm sorry but...nothing.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Oh, now you want a pad.
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
Hey!
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Okay. Sorry.
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
Are you okay?
What?
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
Gotta keep squishing.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
In case it happens.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Thanks.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Oh, my pleasure.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Just the matter of ...payment?
What?
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Oh!
Shut up, I'm happy.
I know the code to his answering machine.
Do you not see it?
Well?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Oh my God. He threw up?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
You look good!
I warned you...
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
That's probably what they'll say.
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Oh good.
That other play?
How much did ever really win before?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
And who laminated it?
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Water rules!
What?
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
What're you gonna do?
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
Light still out?
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
C'mon up.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Do you all promise?
Hey!!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Ross isn't here.
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Phoebe?
Licorice?
Oh no!
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
You're so efficient. I love you!
What the hell happened?!
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
I know!
Isn't he an architect now?
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Mm-hmm.
Ooh, and I can do this.
I love you, too.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
I'll do it!
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
That's it big girl! Come on!
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
Why not?
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
Then why would he say it?
How?
OK, here you go. Good luck.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
We're hanging out.
Hey! How was sailing?
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Yeah, sure.
She will be after tonight.
Really?
So-so you would've just lied?
How are you?
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Ross's parents are my parents!
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
Love is the best medicine.
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
What?! Oh.
I like them a lot.
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
This is insane!
That's great.
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
I thought there wasn't a ball?
I love you!
I know.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
Oh.... my... God.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
NOW!!!!!!!!
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
No, here's your mail.
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
No!
What are you up too?
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
What-what's going on?
So, what's this.
Oh, I-I don't know.
Oh, here.
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
What?!
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Unless!
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
All right then. Bye.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No Phoebe I am mad!
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
I know why!
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
Really?! How much?!
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Hey!
Once!!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
Well, it just seems that...
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Bye Dan!
Cups.
What about the closeness?
Oh, an old glove?
I am, aren't I?
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Yes!
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Okay.
Oh my God, it was incredible.
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Hi, honey.
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Oh...
Rachel?!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Bye.
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
See if he has ice.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Chandler?
Thank you.
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
I don't care.
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
All right, check me out.
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
I was frustrated with you!
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Not as each other!
Why? Because of the government.
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
But what?
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Hey!
You had no relationship!!
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Gin.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Very!
Please tell me it's his mother.
Oh, good. Thanks.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
The show?!
Between you and...
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Oh God!
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Are you serious?
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Then why are you laughing?
I hope she's OK.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
What?
No. See you don't understand.
Yeah.
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
Okay, I'll go!
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Uh, no!!
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Yes, is that okay?
If you want, I'll do it.
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
I blame London.
Who?
Fat?!
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Hi!
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
OK.
What's the matter?
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Mmm.
Did you just smell my hair?
How do you feel?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
So we're back on?
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
You wanna what?!
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Hey!
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
Nothing.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
Here you go sweetie.
We're sorry honey.
What?
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
So, should I call him back?
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
You know Paul?
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
God, what is wrong with me.
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Soakin' up all the culture.
Oh, why is it unfair?
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Morning.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
The Bible?!
Alright.
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Come on! Chandler!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
What took you so long?
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Hey!
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Mr. Heckles.
What?
You're on the phone!
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
All right then.
Enough!
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Chandler!!
I love you too Chandler.
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Or not.
Phoebe?
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Hi, come on in.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Okay.
Oh my God!
I know.
Is it okay for me to come in now?
We do not have one of those signs.
I love you!
Uh, good.
How did it go?
What's Phase Two?
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
Yeah!
Hello.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
That can't be your father.
Just go get some! Go!
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Shh!! Wait, what?
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
So what's Phoebe like?
Really!
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Sure!
What's with all this sand?
Chandler!!
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
Come on, hurry!
I can't believe you bought this.
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Let me try.
Okay, here's your penis!
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Okay!
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
You've never met Bob, have you?
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Oh, wait a minute honey.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
It's almost our anniversary!
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Wait, wait, wait!
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
And Monica knows...
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Yeah baby!
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
I'm not laughing.
Joey... we always know what you mean.
What's so funny?
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Happy New Year.
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
What's with the guitar?
I don't know.
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
That's what you say about porn.
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
Wow! It's small.
Uh-huh!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Keep going.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Why is Ross naked?
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
How about Mockolate mousse?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
So then you know?
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Oh.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Joey, speed it up!
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
I have not been sick in over three years!
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Jody!
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Wow!
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Well, I was having a conversation.
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Oh yeah right!
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
You made it!
I know!
All right, what about the third guy?
It's a diaper commercial.
Oh well, where is he?!
Yes!!
Ohh!
Thank you.
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
I am not wrong.
You need to give him money.
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Great!
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Yeah that's right.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Whoa! Are you okay?
God, you are so strong.
Okay.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Rach, come see who's out here!
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Why isn't it working out?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Will you stop!
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Thank you.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
I got it!!
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
But they like it!
So maybe we should just. . .
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Shhh!
Can you blame him?
Really?
That's not possible!
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Are you a virgin?
I love you.
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
Isn't this great?
What?
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Okay!
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Yeah?
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I'm not your best friend?
Give me the good stuff.
Ah, yeah!
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
We won't. 300?
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
Did that!
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Hey.
So to get this part you can't be?
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Nope.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Yeah.
You're kidding!
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Really?
Saucy!
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Shut up, Joey!
Run, Phoebe, run!
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Look!
Poor thing!
I can't believe we're living here!
Of course!
Joey!
A pill?
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
You bet.
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Forget it.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Yeah.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
I'll get it.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Thanks.
The park huh? A public place.
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Oh!
Okay, what's going on with you?
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
That's stealing!
What?
Why?
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
I remember you did.
Electrical plans for the building.
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
Happy birthday dad.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
No really, they're OK.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
What?
Hey.
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
I gave you a key for emergencies!
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Help yourself.
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
That's not funny.
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
You didn't.
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Then I won't have to kill you.
I'll call you back.
No.
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Hi.
Oh God.
Give it to me.
Ohh.
How many kids were we gonna have?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Anybody lose this?
What?
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Are you still awake?
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
All right.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
I think you're my favorite.
Ow!
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
Oh my God, Richard.
If you want.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
It's Monica, open up!
Tomorrow!
I thought that was a good thing.
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Hi!
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
And you're cute too.
Cut it out.
What?!
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
Well then we still have a problem.
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Okay!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Bye.
Why, how much is that?
Great...
What?!
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Oh.
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Pheebs, how's it going?
How about receiving?
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
Okay.
It's my New Year's resolution!
No.
Bye.
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Hello, Joey.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
I sure do! And you don't get one!
No.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Yeah.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
That was me.
What are you doing?!
No, seriously.
Oh, this is so hard.
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Rach, here's your mail.
You've got to be smooth about it.
I know!
Yeah! Oh yes!
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
No! I'm not okay!
Hi.
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Do you know anything about women?
Why?
Your favorite!
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
I'm gonna miss you so much.
What kind of changes?
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Really?!
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
Yeah.
Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
Hi.
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
He doesn't have anyone.
What the hell are you doing?!
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
Yep, yep...You?
Yeah.
Absolutely!
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Is that some kind of boat talk?
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
What? I didn't say anything.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
What?!
Well, at least you scared someone.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Nooo!
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
I think so.
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
I was in too much pain.
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
I'm a twinkie.
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
You look great too.
You need one too?
What kinda things have you been saying?
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
I made you a surprise.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Are you saying I smell bad?
Thanks.
Hey!
OK, I'll see you later babe.
That's because I'm in front of them.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
All right.
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Hey.
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
So, where do you want to go?
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Joey!
I love this friend thing!
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
No!
Great...
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Joey, do you work here?
That thing is not coming in here.
One!
No.
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Oh no! What's the matter?
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Who? Is that your sister?
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Oh, let's not tell this story.
He could hear me.
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
I mean, was it Gina?
Janice?!
Hello.
Hey!
What's goin' on?
What?!
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Really?!
Let me ask you a question.
I think I need a drink.
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Yeah!
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Hey.
Oww!
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
What?!
I hate this game!
Bye.
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
In like a half-hour?
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Isn't that great?
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Hi!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
I gave you one job!
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Ohh that's sweet!
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Oh! Him.
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Where do you want to start?
How's it going?
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
All right. Mmm-mmm.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
I am the best.
Well, you know.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
What is that?
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Hi!
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
They tore it down a few days early.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Fine, go have sex.
Fine,
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
I'm in the shower!
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Don't do what?
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
Hey!
Ross, she's 25 years old.
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
What did you tell them?
Hey, it's good to see you!
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Really?
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
Some moms do that.
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
You did!
It's for their own good.
Where you can make out with your assistant.
All right, you're hired!
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Alright, check.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Of course not.
You're plans were with us.
But I'm...
Hey guys!
Okay.
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
What do you mean?
I can't believe you're getting married!
Where have you been?
It's Fun Bobby.
Three!
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Stupid.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Oh, honey, the earrings...
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Hey!
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Am not!
Huh?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
But we can go, right?
I'm so happy for you!
Them?! Who's them?
We're good.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Rachel! You okay?
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Hi!
Oh my God! Oh my God!
But you told them you weren't?
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
Oh my God!
Why else would we be here?
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
The best man? Wow!
My surprise party!
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Hey!!
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
After the snap!
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
He hates to lose.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
All right!
Joey!
We didn't order cake.
Sure, I love this part!
Joey! You didn't even know her!
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
And the way she slaps all the time!
Well you did a little bit.
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
What's with him?
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Where were your parents?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Why do you want to see my hand?
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Cute.
All right, I...I have to ask.
Phil!
Ohh!
What is DOOL?
Here you go. You can wear this.
Oh!!
What is going on with you?
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Hey!
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Thank you.
Hi!
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Hey.
Ross!!!
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
This is my favorite part.
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Hi!
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Okay, okay. I hate this.
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Why is it sick?
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
What were you doing in Africa?
Yep! You got the tickets?
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
I do?
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Pete's breaking up with me.
Yes that would be lovely.
Hey!
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
I can't believe you did that.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
You guys, I am not that bad!
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
Yeah, it's good.
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Too strong for me?
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
It's not your birthday.
Oh! You're awake!
What?! Which one?!
Huddle up.
We owe you?!
Well, she saw the ring.
Weird, weird.
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Oh my God!
Hmm?
I'm not gonna go out with him.
What's fish hooking?
Well, I do.
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Did she leave a number?
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
What?!
Oh, that's sounds great.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Oh my God!
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
That's not even a game!
Noo!!
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Hey!
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
This is so much fun!
You don't even know me...
Yeah.
What are you guys gonna do?
Monica.
Really?!
Larry?
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
I would love to do it together!
Okay. I suck!
No, you're the best.
And this goes for all guys?
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
I'm getting married next!!
Thank you.
I know.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
What are you doing?
No it's not.
Maybe I could do it.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
It's coming from the living room.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Oh, god help us.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
My parents will be so happy.
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Sure.
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Was it really that good?
What's the part?
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
No, none at all.
Very bad.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Hi.
We both do that!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
I don't know!
Hi!
It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
What's wrong Phoebe?
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
We'll see.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
YES!!!!!!!!
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
He took off?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
No she hasn't.
Hey!
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
No! No!
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Bye!
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Oh yeah.
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
It's not?
It's my TV.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Hey!
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
What happened in Atlantic City?!
You're doing it again.
Hi guys!
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Do you mind telling us what it is?
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Hormones.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Thank you soo, much.
Did you make brownies today?
Well yeah.
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
So you hit her in the face?
Really?
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Hey!
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Okay.
Tonight?
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Because the winner gets this!
So! He'll understand!
What?
Okay!
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
What are you doing?!
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
That's your call.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
You really ok with it?
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Ok, here, watch this.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Rachel always cries!
But, I put some honey in it.
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
What are you guys doing here?
Come here. Okay, be right back.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
The Luisa from home room!
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
You still have feelings for me don't you?
You can spill. In the sink.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
Oh God.
Hey.
What do you mean?
You what?
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
It's kind of an important one!
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
What?!
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
Okay!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
What is that?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
The second sister dies?!
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Eww!!
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
So are you ok?
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Oh, God forbid.
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
Oh, that is amazing!
Haven't we made this decision?
No, I just, I fell down.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
What? I don't see anything.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Uh-huh.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Who did we fight in World War I?
Well, what's the job?
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Uh-huh.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Nothing.
Well we... we kinda broke up.
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
What's tonight?
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
I won the game.
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Okay.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Do you know what's a bad idea?
No-no-no! We need something old!
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Would you look at them?
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
We're gonna see each other naked.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
Oh, here's a great one.
Yeah.
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
No.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
What?
Yes, you did!
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Pick a number! That is your only job!
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Ross, are you okay?
Could you not look?
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Not now, I'm sick!
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
That's the couch.
Whatever.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
I feel terrible, I really do.
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
You okay?
Alright. Phoebe?
'Scuse me?
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Shut up.
Why do I have to decide?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Yeah, sweetie.
Who are you talking too?
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
I know!
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
So, what are you saying now?
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Oh...
That's all right.
Hi Chandler.
Come here, I want to show you something!
What?!
Chicken Kiev?
Yes.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
The only problem!
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Hey! Good, you're home!
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Feeling a little better sweetie?
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
She lets you borrow them.
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
In the bank.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
All right, you!
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
I'm really not deciding!
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
You did not go!
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Hi.
Hey.
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Emily's straight.
You really think this is okay?
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Who is this?
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
What do you mean?
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
It's uh...
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
You don't have the guts.
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Please.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
I never knew that either.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Yes!!
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
Why don't you just take it with you?
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
Oh my God!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
What, that little thing at the prom?
Score!! 7 to nothing!
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
It's that terrible?
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
How'd the lecture go?
What? I-I said you had a-
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
That's right.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Well no, but um.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
Tomorrow night.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
No.
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
I wasn't escaping.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
That's not gonna work.
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Oh my God.
Hey.
Uh huh.
What is wrong with you?!!!
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Fine!
How did you get in here?
Hey, what's that?
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Worked like a charm.
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
What?!
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Is there? Is there someone else?
Let's do it!
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
You sold me out.
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
Uh, hello.
So, are you ready to go?
I mean really, think about it.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
What are you talking about?
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
What are you smiling at?
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Yep, we wanna get married!
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Phoebe.
Are you sure this time?
You're an opthamologist.
I'll be right there!
New York.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Oh my god.
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Yes?
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
What are you doing here?
Oh God! I gotta go!
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Oh, thank you.
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
What was the dream about?
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
You know what? You're right.
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
I'm gonna miss you!
Why did you hire me?
You owe me 20 bucks.
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Uh, yeah.
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Stick out your tongue.
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Me and Chandler?!
Sorry Joey
All I say is, she better get the job.
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
We just want you to think it through.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
What? We could do it!
Oh, there's banana on it.
Say you're sorry.
Are these the shoes?
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Come on!
We checked. A lot.
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
What?! What is it?!
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Then all your stuff would be here.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Changes?
What?
Rachel's not here.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
You still want to move in together right?
That is never good.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Uh-huh.
Curry.
What's a 'niffle'?
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
This doesn't feel weird!
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Oh my God!
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Just go.
No.
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
You got it.
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
Alright.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Oh my god.
Barry who you almost...?
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Oh my God.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Ross they're really, really, really white.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Like?
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Oh.
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
That was a terrible throw!!
You keep saying that.
He's gonna eat the cake!
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
That cold makes you sound so great.
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Uh, wait, backstage?
This is my dress!
Great. It's gym class all over again.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
I think he's shy.
Mmm-mmm.
We'll put buckles on it.
Of course.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Aw, it's soo unfair.
Well?
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Me going out with Richard's son.
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
She's leaving for three months.
Alright, go on.
Nothing, I don't know.
I know I love you!
And I have costumes.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Hi, nice to meet you!
No I don't.
Hello?
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Oh crap!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
What?
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
So what are you gonna be?
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
You painting his toenails?
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
Okay, bye.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Well, what did you do?
Marcel?
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Hey guys! Hey!
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Hey!
And yet, we're still poking him.
Yeah right.
Hey! There you are!
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
I don't want a ghost.
I saved you a seat.
Okay.
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
I think you're better than you think you are.
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
That was you?
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Hm-hmm!
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Why? Do you have a report due?
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
Oh, put him on!
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
You love her!
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
That counts!
Bye-bye!
Okay, I'm not getting this!
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Nope, she's perfect.
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Monica Gellerrr.
That's okay.
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Something to remember me by!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Hey!
Sorry, Phoebe.
Yes. But all the other ones.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
They've arrested Monica.
Are we still on that?
Not any more.
Oh my God!
Charity?
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Sure.
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
I'm fine.
What?
Ross.
Ewww!
No, just a Friday night.
All right.
Did they just kill off Joey?
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Hi!
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Ow!! Ow!!!
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
What?! What are you doing?!
I'm really gonna miss you.
Hi, honey.
Well so?
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Okay.
That doesn't seem fair.
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
You could do that!
You didn't!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
You stink!
That's fine.
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
Oh Joey!
Phoebe!
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Ohh.
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
You don't have any stuff.
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
Chandler!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
She has to know that your not ready.
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
What?
You okay?
You're kidding! Where? Where?
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Hello, people who do not live here.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
What baby?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Oh, from who?
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Come on, we can't let them win!
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
What time?
Well, what happened?
-leg?
Well, get it off now!
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
Every year.
So how's it going with you guys?
No, thank you.
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
Why?!
Hey guys!
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
How 'bout just a boom?
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
Hexadrin.
You made pancakes?
That was amazing!
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
Really.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
All right.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
And you?
Phoebe that's crazy!
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Hi.
Well, thanks anyway.
Oh my Gosh!
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
Hey.
Yay!
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
That is so funny. Let me see that.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Oh, is everything in the car?
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
How does she do that?
What was her name?
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Rach?
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Ennnh.
Oh... Uh...
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Ohh, absolutely.
Fine!
Yeah.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
No. No, thank you!
I'm so sorry.
I blame London.
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
I know.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
I told you not to go down there!
Then what's the problem?
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
What?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
No-no-no, no!
But my clothes are-ohh!
I'm changing out of this.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Are you okay?
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
I was laughing.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
I got you the foot massager.
Aww, not right now.
That sounds like Nana.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
I am 26.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Uh-hmm.
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Five more and I'll flash you.
Hey!
I highly doubt that.
What are you talking about?
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Um-hmm.
Mine? Right here?
I'm talking about me having a baby.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Yeah.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
No, I'm-I'm serious!
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
We'll be waiting for you...
Wait! What about Joey?
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Don't you have to pee?
Nooo!!
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
And that would be?
Ross, there he is.
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Congratulations!
Hi, again.
Really?
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
I am good. I finished my book.
Which ones?
Gimme them!
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Really?!
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Hang on a second I just got in.
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
I am not!
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Yeah, well they suck too.
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Come on!
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Hey, are you okay?
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
I loved them!
Really, is he a swimmer?
You're not gonna mess it up.
Yes it's true.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Hey.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
No.
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
What's the big deal?
What?
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Yeah, so?
Okay.
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh, did you catch him?!
So, how'd it go?
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Chandler!!
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
He's retiling my floor.
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Are you okay, sweetie?
Pizza?!
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Two!
Break!
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Hmm?
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Can you go any faster with that?
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Umm...
Good, they feel good, in my head.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
W-wait. What is that?
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
You al-you already had it?
What a minute, what did he say?
Go on.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
What if they don't?
What are you doing?
Give them to me.
Oh, Rachel!
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
What?
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
About what?
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Dad!
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
I'm crying here!!
Oh that's great!
What are you talking about?
It's Hexadrin.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Then all your stuff would be here.
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
Okay.
That was you?!
No, you cannot.
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Totally familiar.
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Why not?
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Yes, they can stay with us.
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Hey.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Who wants it? Anybody?
Yeah.
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Are you sure you're okay?
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Okay!
I read to you.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
So how does it look?
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Deal!
Hey! You're wearing pants!
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
No?
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
Just uh, do the right thing.
Joey!
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Oh, you look so great.
Hey, Danny!
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Hide the Lamp.
Do you want me to pick you?!
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
What happened?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
What?
Okay. I love you so much.
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
I am not high maintenance!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
What's wrong with PBS?
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
What the hell is this?
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What are you trying on now?
Yeah.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Hi.
Oh my god.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Really? Your work laugh?
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Hi.
Ross? Let's go.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Not a basset, a bassinet.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Do you love her?
Okay, throw it straight this time.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Well Rachel's not here!
Wow, is that Michelle?
Oh my God!
Then what is it?
How have you been?
So?!
Mom, I'm hungry.
The fake kind!
But my clothes are-ohh!
Okay. Umm...
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Yeah, no, me neither.
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
...Pheebs?
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
What?! What is it?
So she's a woman! So what?
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
I-I-I think you look great.
I don't know, clean places?
What were we thinking?
Hey!
They'r alright.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
I'll get back to my new job.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Okay.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
We didn't give you any money!
Pass the cheese, please.
They'r alright.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Sorry, Pheebs.
Toothpick?
I guess they're back from their date.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Hey! How's it goin'?
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
We all chipped in.
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
That is so sweet!
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Oh, Larry.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
What are you doing with the lamp?
Ohh!
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Nooo!
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Hey Pheebs!
I like that. What?
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Oh that's great!
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
I don't know why I'm here.
Hey!
Kinda. Oh my God!
Hi!
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Hey, the man's dog just died.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Why?
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
What? Honey.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Keep talkin'.
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
You did a minute ago!
Hey, I went up.
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
You have to go to London!
It's nice.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Joey that is so sweet.
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
Well then get it, get it!
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Lots of responses.
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
We have got to wash that!
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Oh.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
No it is not!
We are not going to whistle.
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
And?
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Oh...
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Here's your key
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Hey. Where's Joey?
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
Well, not anymore.
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
And he's a great brother!
Yeah, I do know.
Come on.
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
Sure! Okay, you go first.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
Well, how bout just her mom?
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Oh, great!
Make a wish?
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
I have no idea.
Hey! Don't be a baby!
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
No!
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
Oh.
You're welcome.
Lucky bastard! Janice.
Wow, what?
Done?
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
OK.
Me too!
Over here dad.
Ross.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
No.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
How'd you pay for them?
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Was he crying?
What uh-What did you-What?!
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
So what're you gonna do?
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
I can do that!
Do you have a plan?
I've gotta get back in the game.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Hey.
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Anything but stew.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Okay! My turn! My turn!
It is not over! You're over!
What are you doing?
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
You did it! You got ordained?!
He is so amazing.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Oh... shoot.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
Gin.
I'll take care of it.
Look!
It's work.
Jeffery.
What?
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
One two three.
Huh?
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Define fun.
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Cache? Jaunty?
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Alright.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Wow.
I know!!
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
How much?
And you're not gonna do that.
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Regular or decaf?
Okay!
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Okay, I gotta go.
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Great.
Oh My God.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
I used to wet my bed.
Ohh, fun!
No, I haven't seen him.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Hello.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Okay!
You used to have carpet.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Damn! It's empty!
I was probably waiting for it to open.
Hate that guy!
Oh my.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Hey!
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
I knew you were not okay with that.
Joey, you don't have too!
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
We had a characturist!
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
No, I really, really do.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Come on eight.
Hey!
Uh-huh.
What?
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
Oh my God it's old!
Hello?
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Great!! That's great!
It's so good, isn't it?
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
Pheebs?
No.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Phoebe?
Uh-oh, it was bad?
Hey!
What happened to Janine?
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Uh-hmm.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
I'm so glad you liked them!
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Mmmmm.
What!?
Just...please tell him.
You gave her food poisoning!?
What are you doing?
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
People! People say it! Come here!
Ow!
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
Absolutely.
All right, look at my on the back page.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Actually, I did!
I thought she just had one.
Still crying?
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Hi, Geoffrey.
We said six!
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
That's great!
No, I just talked to them.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Ross, that is gorgeous!
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
Aww! I love you!
No!
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Hoyt?
Have you found your dress yet?
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
You didn't know that already?
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Y'know, just be there for her.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Hey.
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
I need to get some Richard.
Sorry.
How do you feel?
Oh my god good?
No he went out to get pizza.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Thanks.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Please! I made this game what it is.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Gimme 'em!
Was it...?
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
They won't take you to the vet.
Excuse me?!
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Excuse me, where are you going?
you don't have insurance?
Why not?
All of us.
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Third door on the left.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
What is it?
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Ohh.
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
You don't want to know what tonight was.
This bottle opener.
All right, come here!
How ya feelin'?
Yeah.
Quit flicking
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Why?
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
I'm-I'm Monica.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Who cares? He works in a museum!
How who wears it?
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
This is not the bed I ordered!
Why is everything different?
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Pete, can I get you something else?
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Yeah!
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Hey-hey.
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Why?
You know, a party, or--
You're not a senior?
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
You just asked me.
No, that is what the game is.
His dancing partner?!
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Okay.
Because then I don't have to!
Honey, we gotta go!
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Okay!!
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
What happened to your teeth.
So you didn't leave the bank?
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Why do you need it?
Now, open your eyes.
What?! Excuse me!
Oh, sorry.
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
You become friends after?
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
No really, they're OK.
Or 45.
How? I don't have any money.
Break.
Rach?
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Hey!
Joey!
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Hey!
Yeah, there you go!
Hey!
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Chandler?
I'm outta here.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Okay.
So what happened?
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
And slept with the professor.
All right.
So the going for help went well?
What?
Hey baby.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Aww...
Why don't you just get a roommate?
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
How about, you're moving!!
Wow.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Or! A bakery delivery person.
Hey.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Hi.
Well, thanks, we like him.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
There's an ad for a naked chef?
No. I hate this part.
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Me too.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Ohhh, nice.
Guys, what's going on?
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
How?
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
You do?!
007 has a fancy car!
Okay!
Thank you.
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Yeah.
I'm not talking to her!
Is he not cute enough for you?
What?!
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
You just carry that around?
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
She really left.
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
What?!
Oh my God!
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Yeah!
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Please!
No! You have lasagnas!
I am. I'm that stupid.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Joey, promise me something.
You serious?!
Really?
Well, it's getting late.
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
How's the big anniversary dinner?
No, I will not cave.
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
There you go!
Hey!
I know. I need more pie.
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Okay.
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
You really think this is okay?
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Not even close.
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
That's insurance fraud.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
...What did I ask?
I know.
All right.
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
What!!?
Well, we certainly are alone.
Yes.
What's 'pleh'?
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh my God!
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Let go!
Rachel!
Hey!
You sold me out.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Me too.
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Okay.
What?!
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Okay...who are you?
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
From here to the airport?
No no no no.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Yeah, well, is that better?
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
How about we play for more money, say 150?
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Okay!
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
What?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Ok, that's enough.
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Yes!
All right? What's going on?
You still work at the multiplex?
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Would it really have been that easy?
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Here we go again.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Oh, that'd be great.
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Oh, good.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
You were invited?!
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Yay!
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
Hey umm, what's this?
Oh my.
Oh and you know what I want!
Keep talking.
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Yeah.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Bye.
Are you sure?
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
I don't think there's anything.
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Edward Nevski?
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Hey!
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
You be okay?
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Why?!
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Julie.
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Okay.
What?
I know. I just can't find...
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
But the mess!
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Oh May 15th.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
It's gonna be so great.
I didn't change!
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
You love me!
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
This is Rachel.
He's so cute.
How many fingers am I holding up?
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
He's a dropper!
Never call me from that phone.
We, we just wanna see the end.
Ross, cough drops, please?
He took my snack!
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
Do you always have to bring him here?
No it's not, it's second.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Great!
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Please!!
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
No, only because that's the graduation song.
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
That's terrible.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Thanks!
Um-hmm.
It's good to see you too.
But you are?
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Waaay too special.
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Pete.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Hey.
Hey!
All right, so what do you say?
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
That's the surprise!
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Oh-oh, my God!
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
How's it going?
Oh, that's great!!
Oh, Chantal!
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
What is that?
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
I am loud!
How did work go?
I thought you could use the help.
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
Did not.
Last night.
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
What?
That's so gross!
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Hey!
Joey, we have something to tell you.
You have dinosaur checks?
Hi Ben!
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Men are such idiots.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Me too.
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Did you like it?
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Wow!
Okay.
I don't think mine likes me either.
What about the part where he has rabies?
What?
All right, I'll try not to.
Chandler!
Hi.
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Okay.
Hey!
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Clogs.
I never stop thinking about it.
And Joey.
Hmm?
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
So you're free Thursday, then.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
Did you just flick me?
What?
No.
Got me.
Hey, guys.
Bye!
Nooo!
Hi.
No we're not.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Oh, you're right.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Great.
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
I mean don't you trust her?
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Oh God!
Maye it's me.
I know!!!
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Whoa!
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Rach? What are you doing?
I'm gonna set them to my time.
No! Phoebe!
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Well that's pathetic!
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Why not?
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
What?!
Don't come in here!
You'd better run!
So I'm kissing everyone?
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Yeah!
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
You're not supposed to look!
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Maybe.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
Let's get the show on it!
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
All right, what's goin' on?
Chandler.
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Give me that!
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Okay!
So, what do you think we should do?
I swear you said you had the keys.
Yeah, me too!
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
The baby shower for Phoebe!
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
I'm sorry.
Oh my God.
Ross, can I?
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
There was nudity!
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
What are you doing with those?!
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
What?
What?
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Oh.
What?
Why would you do that?
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
Okay, fine.
Anything larger back there?
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
That you're a liar.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
What did you say?
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Noo!!
Oop, your cake is ready!
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
They're still in my coat.
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Why?!
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
Not any more!
Really?! You promise?
Hey.
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Well, I think so.
Hey.
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
That counts!
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
You look cute in bubbles.
I'll try.
Do you think he knew I was here?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
Oh.
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
What?
OK. Just for a little while.
What's this?
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Okay, here comes another camera.
I was always Joanne.
Yeah!
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Yeah, that's a big step.
Oh, no thanks.
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
...love you.
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Oh my God!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
I'm outa here.
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
What?
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
1250.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Hi!
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Chandler is such an idiot!
That is so unfair!
What?!
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Jacket now.
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
How did that happen?
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
You really think that'll work?
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
Really?!
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Yeah?
The wedding starts at six.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
It's like two miles!
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
And it's a magnet!
What?
Yes, we are.
I can't believe this!
C'mon!
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Oh, good.
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Joey!
Wh-what, why?
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
No drops!
They were lovers.
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Naked?
About a half an hour.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Maurice.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
It's Joey's birthday.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Rachel said everything was okay.
Are you sure?
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Bye.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Hey!
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
No, it's more like a good luck.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
And I would have to say pah-huh.
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Hey! How was it?
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Are you alone?
Does it involve travel?
I heard that!
Ross!
Which?
There's a game?
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Aww, man!
Well, you're not working either.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
You're not on TV.
Urghh!!
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Ow!
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Why would I have the keys?
I wanna wear this everyday.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Are you okay?
He's... our age.
What?
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
Shoot! We're out of soda.
Oowww!!
Hello?
Wow! You are really fast!
Yeah.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Yesss!!
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
You know the words! You are so into this!
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
What d'you think?
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Oh my god.
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
No.
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
You thought about that?
What?
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Joan?
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Bonjour, monsieur.
Hi Phoebe.
Same category?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
Oh God!
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Is Joey here?
You're his bitch.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Hey!
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
What are we gonna do?
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
I do.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
No.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
Wow!
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Twelve dollars an hour.
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Me neither.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Chandler what do you say?
Joey!
I'd do anything for you.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
I am so jealous.
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
She's right there.
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Have you seen Chandler?
Oh.
Um-hmm.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
I know, but you have to open it today!
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Really?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Give it to me.
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Put it out!!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Oh, then go Vassar.
But you live here! You know that.
So, did I hear Poconos?
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
That's my pie!
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Oh my God!
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Sit down! We're winning!
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Right.
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Just go over and say hi.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Hi.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Yes, it was!
No! We only mess around at his place!
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Hey!
Rachel! That was a library card!
I know.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Yeah.
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
And his puppet too.
Stop it!
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Really?!
Oh man!
Okay.
Yeah. You!
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
What?
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
'I am Bea.'
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
Joey, I'm in!
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Okay.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Bunny!
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Yeah, am I in it?
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
It's kind of an important one!
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
No he's not!
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
I bet this will work!
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Ross!
See he's nice. Right?
Yes!!
For what?
Why can't you use the phone in here?
What?
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Really? Why?
I'm so happy for me.
Really?!
That is not true!
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Oooh!
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Oh, really?!
Wasn't there a little song?
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
What?!
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Why not?
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Dead leg!!
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
That's true.
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Really?!
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
I can't believe he did this.
I want a baby.
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
I love you, Pete!!!
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Are you alright?
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
I'm afraid so.
That's right.
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Yes!
Good night!
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Here, take a couple of these.
I think so too.
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Yeah! Richard!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Emily Waltham.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
This is disgusting!
All you had to do was buy the card!
David who?
Hi...May I help you?
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Yeah, me too.
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Why?
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Okay.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
My brother, Ross.
Paris?
We have one.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
You got a callback too didn't you?
No.
Oh, this is so great.
What?!
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Oh?
Really?
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Put all my money in me.
Still smoking cigars?
Oh my-Oh good God!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Ohh.
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
So, did you do it?
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
What's going on?
You are just the sweetest.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Really?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
I love you too Chandler.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Not at these prices.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
Well, I just caught the live show.
We were just waxing our legs.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Hi!
Hey!
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Really?
Game!
Come on Rach, let's go.
Your a poet and don't know it.
I don't know sweetie.
In.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
So um, who was she?
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Go! Go! Go!
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
Oh!
What?!
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
"See you around?"
What?
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Why, exactly?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
It's Danny.
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Oh boy me too!
This bicep?
Totally!
What about these? These look the same?
I think you look fine.
Cat hair.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
What?!
Hi.
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
I can't! I have to work!
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
And that's Pete's Mom.
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Noooo!!!!
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Chandler!
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
What's up?
Really!
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
I know I do.
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
What are you the memory woman?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Really?
A kiss? What are you talking about?
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Oh, yeah.
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
Hi.
There were only twelve.
You bought a boat?
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
About what?
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Hi Mr....Bing.
Then why did you move?!
Oh no!
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
Hey.
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
You can let some of them go by!
Hey!
No, give me the...
Sometimes we were.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Hey guys.
What?
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Nestle Tollhouse?!
You stink!
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Oh, you're kidding.
She sent the chicken back again?!
You dated her!
Eldad, this is Rachel.
Why?
Sixty guests.
Happy birthday!!!
Shut up!
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Hey!
We're never gonna find anybody.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Wow, this really sucks.
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Okay.
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Uh-huh, yeah.
That's okay.
Hey.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
If the school finds out you're fired.
What's the matter?
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Joey.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Give it. Give it.
I don't want things to change! Do you?
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
'Kay, here you go.
Pretty much.
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
That's right. Did you hear something?
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Hey!
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Why not?!
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
You have got to go home!
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
We're not doing anything.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Joey, what are you doing?
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
It's okay, it's okay.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Well, you're-you're sweating.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
I don't want a beer.
Aww, thank you.
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Ross, we can handle this.
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
What?
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Joey!
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
You stole them from me!
Just waiting for you sweetie.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Hey sweetie!
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
It's 9:30 in the morning!
I think she's here.
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Okay.
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
No.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
No way!
Hi.. how was the game?
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Wow.
You didn't even take off your pants.
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
We're kidding!
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Are you sure?
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Oh, I-I don't know.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Take care.
Mom, it's OK.
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
God Ross, what is that?
Sooo?
Okay.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Come on! I really need your help!
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
Hi!
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Huh?
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Bing's weird.
No, you?
Great!
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
You changed?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Really?
Really?!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
I was kidding.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Okay.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Viva Las Gaygas!
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
No.
Yes, you're having a boy!
Ow!!
Yes, you are so smart!
You realize what you are don't you?
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
What?!
Fifteen minutes.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Would you please go?
Carol moved her stuff out today.
Ten dollars an hour.
Yes.
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Ross didn't scare you?
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
What are you crazy?!
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
Yes!
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Thank you so much Phoebe.
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Oh, I already have one.
I am so glad you said cooks.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Sorry, Rach.
What is it?! What about Pete?
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Of course.
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Unless...
Score! Now can we go?
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Well, didn't you?
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
I think you're done.
It was.
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
For what?
Oh yeah. Definitely.
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
How desperate am I?
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Oh, yeah, right.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
That noise you just made?
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Frozen lasagnas?
Here you go.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
What about me?
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Rachel, how did this happen?
Of course!
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Yeah, Ginger something.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
What?!
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Hey!
What is it?!
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
I promise.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Well, I guess now we can't go.
But I didn't.
Rachel?!
What's going on with you?
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
That's much better.
Are you mocking me?
That really was some of your best work.
Phoebe, that stuff is...
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Why?
Yes.
Does he not make enough money?
Phoebe!
I'm Monica.
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Okay. Here's the thing.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
Hi Chandler.
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Ok...ay.
Mmmm, no.
It's not mayonnaise!!
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
Ugh!
Yeah!
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Well, what's the part?
All right, then show me some manly moves.
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
How-how are you, Mom?
Cause I already invited her.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
What is it?
Ah!
Are you crazy?!
I will.
Did you two...
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
How'd it go?
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
What happened?
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Oops.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Yeah, right.
Oh, just until the glue dries.
What kind of karate is that?
What kinda stuff?
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Rachel, that's all we do.
Don't say it.
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Break!
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
That is wild.
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
You're gonna what?
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Oh God!
One.
Hi.
Rachel's at work.
Oh, please.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
You're right.
What for?
Hey guys.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Yeah. I guess.
Look at you. All jealous.
Very good.
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Who are they killing off?
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Oh, no!
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
Merry Christmas!!
No.
Bye!
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Michael.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Nooo!
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
What?
Richard!
Relieved?
You start working on that list.
Honey, we have been through this before!
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Yeah.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Nooooo. You're really not going?
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
Shut up, and put my table back.
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
You didn't find her?
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Umm.
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
Or incredibly offensive.
Well, what happened?
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Well there's not much we can do.
Joey, this is you!
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Big time!
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
How?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
What?!! What?
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Does that smell bother you?
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
I don't know.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Thanks again.
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Look at this.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
And you're cute too.
Okay.
Y'know, I never saw that.
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
What?
Phoebe, what are you doing?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Umm, well, he's...
Brides magazines?
No, we don't.
What's the matter?
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Now?
I know!
I am!!
Who is it?
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Ready? Wrestle!
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
No.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
Oh yeah? When?
Bye!
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Hey.
You're meeting Richard?
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Hi!
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
The green dress? Really?
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
What's the matter?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
So have you called her yet?
Rachel, get the book! The book!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
The head tilt?
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Hey!
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Christmas cookie?
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
We'll see.
Eh, you work for that.
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
007 gets all the ladies.
Good for you, Joey.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
I have no idea what you just said.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
I'll pick it up for you!
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
I do not have baby fever!
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Really?
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Bye.
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Hey!
That, you get? That, you get?
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Oh, that's too bad.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Pulling what? It's second down.
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Oh my God!
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
So you had fun, huh?
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
You are?
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Chandler, what were you thinking?
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
We have a baby?
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
What?! You're going out with her again!
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Oh, y'know..
You'll vamp?!
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Let me get you some coffee.
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Hey!
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Hello, Chandler.
They're green?
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Have you even had a girl up here?
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
No you robot!!
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Ross!
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Look, Phoebe!
Okay, you ready to open yours?
No, sorry.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Rach, did you check the machine?
Oh shut up!
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
You're not just saying that are you?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Hi!
Really?
Who's Denise?
There is no alley behind Macy's.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Yeah, what is it?
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
No. Why?
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
It's good to see you
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Well, maybe you don't need them.
Had it.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Another good point.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Well, what about his family?
Betrothed...
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Hi.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Really?
Alright, you wanna feel better?
I know!!!
That's true.
No! You can't do that!
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Woo-hoo, stuud!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
And who pays for that?
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
I don't know.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
You didn't find her?
Like a pirate?!
Are you serious?
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
G'bye, Nana.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Yeah!
It's actually going to be just family.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
There's my little boy.
Not now.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
It's an expression.
Is your tongue swelling up?
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
So do them for free.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
What?
Okay well that's good to know.
Is that all?
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Alright.
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
I see pizza!
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
This isn't even my dress.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Hey!
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Keep talking.
Now calm down Joey.
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
I don't think so.
Oh, c'mon in.
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
You want some help with that?
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Phoebe!
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Isn't it.
That's that weird voice again.
You'll do what?
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Aren't you gonna...
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
You okay?
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Hey.
Two girls and a boy?
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Chandler, why are you doing this?
That's very funny!
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
Hell no, we'll pay!
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Why don't you just go out with her!
I get the dollhouse!
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
I was frustrated.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
That was unbelievable!
I do not like that woman!
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Good. What made you change your mind?
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Okay.
How was your first day?
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Hey.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Yeah, I knew.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Fifteen minutes.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
What?!!
What, forget it!
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Oh my God!
I know it is the best.
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Okay. That was her right?
Hi, Josh.
I can't believe he did this.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Yeah!
Why is this car in my bedroom?
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
I don't know what else to say.
Judy.
Yes.
I got it!
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Oops.
What did you say?
Would you stop?
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Yeah.
Hey, what's up?
Did you break up with her?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Great!
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
No you didn't.
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
I'm fine.
Oh my God!
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
What, he doesn't like Josh?
Are you okay?
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Never done that before.
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
It's Richard Burke.
You gave my father a lap dance!
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
My God! Is this a gym card?
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
How was that possible?
Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Vividly.
Oh God.
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
What?
Bye-bye.
Really.
Thanks.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
You too.
