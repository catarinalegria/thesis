Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Joey we know you steal our food.
In 1981 you were 13!
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Or 45.
That's very nice.
Yeah!
Uh-huh.
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Okay!
Phoebe?
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Huddle up.
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
What?
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Are you a virgin?
Okay!
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Yes!!
Fine,
Oh good.
Bye!
I don't know sweetie.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Phoebe!
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
It's actually going to be just family.
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
Well, it's getting late.
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
I love you too Chandler.
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Chasing him all around the room?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Emily's straight.
Would you look at them?
What?
Ross, I thought you were over this.
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
And?
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Bonjour, monsieur.
Oop, your cake is ready!
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
I'm outta here.
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Same category?
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
I thought there wasn't a ball?
You still want to move in together right?
They're nice guys.
What, he doesn't like Josh?
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Oh.
Rachel?!
How? I don't have any money.
Yeah.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
Well you did a little bit.
He loves you.
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
What is it hon?
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
They'r alright.
What's that?
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
But what?
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
I bet this will work!
I don't know, clean places?
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Yeah, you should.
Julie.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Hey.
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Now, open your eyes.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
You're welcome.
Bye.
Really?
Hey.
And did he?
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Thanks.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
I want a baby.
Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Bite me.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
In...in two weeks.
So what did you do today Pete?
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Thanks.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Oh crap!
So um, who was she?
Yes, but you are dead inside.
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
The park huh? A public place.
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Happy New Year.
Uh-hmm.
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Chandler!
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
This totally makes sense!
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
Well, at least you scared someone.
Ennnh.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
I'm not your best friend?
Sure! Okay, you go first.
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
Y'know, just be there for her.
Why is Ross naked?
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
What?!
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Hello?
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Hello?
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Is that all?
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
That can't be your father.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Well then get it, get it!
They tore it down a few days early.
Hey!
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Oh, just do it!!
Hey! How's it goin'?
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Thank you.
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
I'm changing out of this.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
Game!
Score!! 7 to nothing!
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Are you okay, sweetie?
Uh, no!!
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
Even with me?
Hi.
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Oh gosh.
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
How many?
I know!
Wouldn't you be?
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
What happened to your teeth.
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Shhh!
Okay! My turn! My turn!
There's more beer, right?
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Of course not.
How-how are you, Mom?
I think she's here.
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
What do you mean?
Urghh!!
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Okay. Sorry.
Hi, again.
Oh, good.
Oh my God.
Yeah, sweetie.
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
He is the man in the black dress.
I don't know.
Just...please tell him.
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
So-so you would've just lied?
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Yeah, right.
What time?
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
You'll do what?
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
What the hell happened?!
Do you?
Wow! That guy is so rude!
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
How much longer?
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
What was her name?
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
Fifteen minutes.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
I can't find garbage bags!
Nothing. Nothing.
Really?! You promise?
Oh my-Oh good God!
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
I get the dollhouse!
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
No.
What's with the guitar?
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Hey.
So to get this part you can't be?
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
Okay. I can do that.
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
One two three.
I could do that.
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Oh, honey.
Yeah, so?
You did!
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
It's work.
I know.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
No you don't.
Yo- hooo!
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
Why can't you use the phone in here?
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Enough!
I was always Joanne.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Oh, sweetie!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
No it is not!
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
What?! You slept with Jason?
What?
No, I haven't seen him.
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Did you just smell my hair?
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
What are you doing?!
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
Well, who's voice was that?
Really?
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
I don't know.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Maybe I could do it.
Ross!
We do not have one of those signs.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Carol moved her stuff out today.
Yes. But all the other ones.
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Well, not anymore.
What?!!
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
You still have feelings for me don't you?
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
Okay.
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
And Joey.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Will you stop!
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Bye-bye.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Um-mm.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Sometimes we were.
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Good, they feel good, in my head.
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
All right, I'll see you guys later.
It's gonna be so great.
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Oh no!!
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Phoebe?
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Anything larger back there?
Are these the shoes?
He's so cute.
Okay.
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
What is the worse part?
Are we still on that?
What's that supposed to mean?
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Brrrrrrr!
Oh, c'mon in.
Ok.
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
You wanna what?!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
I know. How could we have let this happen?
What?
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Pizza?!
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
Why?
Alright.
You really think that'll work?
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Hey.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Actually, I did!
Let's do it!
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Okay.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
I think you look fine.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
What did you do to his sweater vests?
All right, check me out.
You stole them from me!
Are you sure?
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Keep talking.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Hey!
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
No.
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
But my clothes are-ohh!
Really!
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
Yeah!
Phoebe moved out.
Ugh!
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
Why do you care so much anyway?
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
I do not have baby fever!
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
See? It's no big deal.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Hmm.
Why not?
Oh my God!
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
He is so amazing.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
What?!
No you're not.
Uh, yeah.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Oh, no...
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Art it is.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Why are so mad at him?
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Just mine?
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
We have a baby?
Hey, are you okay?
Shhhh!!!
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Ok will do. So glad you came.
The head tilt?
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
You want some help with that?
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
I have no idea.
Okay.
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Really?
Very good.
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
I love this friend thing!
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Hey! My first review is out!
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Just go.
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
I'm not talking to her!
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
All I say is, she better get the job.
I love you.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
How much did ever really win before?
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
And who laminated it?
Hmm?
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
I am not wrong.
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
What is it?
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
What?
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
I was frustrated.
He's retiling my floor.
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Do you want me to pick you?!
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Oh that's great!
Joey, you had the night!
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
This is so much fun!
Hmm, bite me.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Hey, Rach, how was work?
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
No.
What are you up too?
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
What?
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Alright.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Hey!
She's leaving for three months.
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Well good, here let me help you out.
What are you doing with the lamp?
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Oh my god.
Give it to me.
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Oh, that's sounds great.
It's that terrible?
Why, do you write him a lot?
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
No.
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Oh-oh, my God!
That was a terrible throw!!
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Oh yeah? When?
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
Wait! What about Joey?
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Come on, hurry!
It's good to see you too.
Ewww!
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Eww!!
Woo-hoo, geeek!
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
No, here's your mail.
What?
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Nooo!
Oh, that is amazing!
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
Oh good.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Of course.
This is disgusting!
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Monica Gellerrr.
We are there!
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
You look good!
Why isn't it working out?
You said the baby.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Are you through with that?
Pete, can I get you something else?
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Twelve dollars an hour.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Let me get you some coffee.
This woman's living my life.
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
It was.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
If you want, I'll do it.
Really?
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Thank you!
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
What, forget it!
Oh my God.
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Just uh, do the right thing.
Really.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
And his puppet too.
That's okay.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Do you know anything about women?
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
That's not funny.
What?
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Yeah.
Ten dollars an hour.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
Cute.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Oh, that's too bad.
Ahhh!!
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
...Pheebs?
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
Hey, I know I what I want!
Y'know, I never saw that.
We have one.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Hey.
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
It's Fun Bobby.
I won the game.
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What are you doing here?
Uh, hello.
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Hey!
What are you talking about?
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
I'll get it.
What?
Aww, not right now.
When, when did-how, how did you...
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Then what's the problem?
They've arrested Monica.
Joey, you don't have too!
Hello?
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Uh-huh.
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Hi Phoebe.
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Ohh!
Okay! Ohhh no!
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
No.
Hi.
Tell him.
Hell no, we'll pay!
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
Okay, okay. I hate this.
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
How, how did that happen?
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
That's all right.
We'll see.
But you are?
We'll see.
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Oww!
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
Good. What made you change your mind?
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Why don't you just go out with her!
Maybe.
A small puff of air, now come on!
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Yeah.
It's kind of an important one!
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Pulling what? It's second down.
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Is someone there?
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Would you stop?
Cache? Jaunty?
Well, I was having a conversation.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
I wasn't escaping.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
Relieved?
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Uh-huh.
Hi!
You know what? You're right.
Okay that does sound like fun.
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Look, Phoebe!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
I know, it is isn't it?
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Oh, that's nice!
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Joey that is so sweet.
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
It's your birthday!
Is there? Is there someone else?
Well there's not much we can do.
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Wow, you worked in a mine?
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Kinda. Oh my God!
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
No, that's not mine.
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Great!! That's great!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
So you hit her in the face?
What are we gonna do?
Aren't you gonna...
Wait, he's not here yet.
That's it big girl! Come on!
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
Third door on the left.
That was me and Ross.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Yeah.
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Really?
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
What?
Know when to stop.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Which?
Are you scared?
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
Hey, Danny!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
So then you know?
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
I got you a present!
Great!
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
All right, I guess we should go.
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Honey! Dinner's ready!
What about when I started dating Chandler?
I had to go with the odds Rach.
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
What?
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Watch the thorns!
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Feeling a little better sweetie?
I swear you said you had the keys.
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
'Scuse me?
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yes, we are.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Hi, Josh.
Honey, we have been through this before!
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
Yep, we wanna get married!
Wow!
What's so funny?
You sold me out.
Ohh that's sweet!
Have you seen Chandler?
What's with him?
You look great too.
I know the code to his answering machine.
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Uh-huh, yeah.
Honey, what's the matter?
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
I don't know.
Why is it sick?
Yes.
What?
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
Joey, what are you doing?
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Hello, Chandler.
Toothpick?
Does that smell bother you?
We just want you to think it through.
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
I am so glad you said cooks.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
OK.
Ross didn't scare you?
Hey!
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
What was it for?
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
What?
What's wrong Phoebe?
Well we... we kinda broke up.
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Hey.
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
No he went out to get pizza.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
I have not been sick in over three years!
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
You be okay?
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
No.
Isn't it.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
Ok, here, watch this.
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
What?!
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Oh, I already have one.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Cat hair.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
You really think this is okay?
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Hey!
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Hey, you guys.
Betrothed...
I think so.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
And! We also have speaker phone.
Bye.
Hi guys.
Umm...
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Oh no! What's the matter?
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
That is so unfair!
What about the closeness?
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
What are you guys gonna do?
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
You dated her!
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Come here. Okay, be right back.
Waaay too special.
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
You okay?
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
Here, let me try.
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
What?
Hey.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Look at you. All jealous.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Yeah?
Why?
What?!
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
I know!
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
He took off?
I'm just trying to spice it up!
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Eldad, this is Rachel.
Hi.
Nice.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
I was frustrated with you!
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Gin.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Excuse me, where are you going?
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
No.
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
What?!
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
The green dress? Really?
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Okay, I'm not getting this!
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
No, that is what the game is.
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
If the school finds out you're fired.
Nope. Schhorry.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
Sixty guests.
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
You're right.
Hey, what's that?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
I remember you did.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
I don't know.
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Okay!
What?
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Look!
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
This is my dress!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
No.
I hate this game!
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
I'm sorry.
Brides magazines?
What for?
What?
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Chandler!!
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Great!
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Oh May 15th.
That's because I'm in front of them.
Thank you.
What are you guys doing here?
Home is Home Star stew.
But they like it!
He is right, isn't he?
Ok, that's enough.
Hey!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
And they weren't looking at you before?!
Charity?
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Pretty much.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
He might still show up.
Aw, it's soo unfair.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
All right, look at my on the back page.
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
I made you a surprise.
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Phoebe, tell her!
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
What's goin' on?
Does it have to do with Joey?
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
They'r alright.
You're not a senior?
Hi.
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
Excuse me?!
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Who is it?
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Why, how much is that?
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Just go get some! Go!
I know! I know.
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Sperm.
I know!
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Are you all right?
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
What is it?!
Guys, what's going on?
Well that's pathetic!
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Well, what about his family?
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Look!
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Wow! It's small.
Fifteen minutes.
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Hah!
That's insurance fraud.
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Gimme them!
It's my TV.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
I do.
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Hi!
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Oh, I love museums!
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
How are you doing?
A kiss? What are you talking about?
What if I turn out the lights?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Nooo!
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
You've never met Bob, have you?
Done?
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
She's bluffing!
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
No!
What's up?
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
I love you.
So you watched the movies huh?
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
That's true.
You're not gonna be phased out!
Hey.
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
What's the big deal?
Did you go home and change?
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
I think I need a drink.
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Oh My God.
That'll work!
Clogs.
You know the words! You are so into this!
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Well, I just caught the live show.
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
No, you?
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
How did that happen?
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Hi!
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
I so wanna be attracted to you.
So, did I hear Poconos?
Oh God!
What's this?
I know I do.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
I'm-I'm Monica.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
No!
Are you still awake?
Like a pirate?!
Okay.
Oh, this is so hard.
Oh, he's catching up to her!
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
You didn't!
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
How who wears it?
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Stop it!
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Bodington's!
Ow!! Ow!!!
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Or not.
Oh yeah.
Ok, then just go.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Really?
Oh man! I did it again!
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Sure!
Is your tongue swelling up?
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
The second sister dies?!
All right, so what do you say?
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Well put it back.
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Oh, Chantal!
Because then I don't have to!
Wh-what, why?
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Weird, weird.
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Oh man!
Thank you.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Well, I think so.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
Okay!
We said six!
Is it the Italian guy?
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Bye!
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Please, guys, we have to talk.
I don't know what else to say.
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
What?
And you're cute too.
Yeah!
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
No! Phoebe!
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
Hey-hey.
Give me that.
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Not even close.
Okay, what's going on with you?
Morning.
All right, then show me some manly moves.
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Please tell me it's his mother.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
Oh, this is so great.
Umm.
That's not possible!
Hey guys!
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Why don't you just call her?
Oh! Him.
Phil!
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
I need to get some Richard.
Hey.
This was your idea?
Hi!
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
Oh...
And you know what? We want a rematch.
Oh, god help us.
I wanna wear this everyday.
What're you gonna do?
Yes, you're having a boy!
Why would we do that?
Do you think he knew I was here?
You got it.
What-what are you doing?
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Your a poet and don't know it.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
You didn't find her?
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Paul!
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Ohhh, nice.
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Alright, go on.
What?!
I can't believe you bought this.
Okay.
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Hey.
All right, be my guest.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
I am not!
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Yeah.
Hey!
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Yeah, me too!
Rachel! That was a library card!
Uh-huh.
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Hey!
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Me too.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
What?
Am not!
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Still crying?
Jacket now.
Because it's my apartment!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Whoa!
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Anything but stew.
Yeah, that's a big step.
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Okay.
Oh, that'd be great.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Okay!
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
No. See you don't understand.
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
That's what it sounded like.
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
There's our star!
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Ohh.
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
What are you doing?
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Bye-bye!
What, that little thing at the prom?
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Stop!
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Yeah, I knew.
Hey!
Do you love her?
Oh.
I just asked you.
Me too.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Chandler!
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
That's right.
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
You stink!
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Shut up! This place is a hole!
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Not any more!
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Yes!
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
And I would have to say pah-huh.
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Yeah.
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Hi.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
I don't know!
No one.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
What's going on with you?
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
You become friends after?
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Okay.
Yeah.
What's the charity?
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Now?
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Three!
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Not as each other!
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Ross!!
That cold makes you sound so great.
Bye.
Nah... not-not special enough.
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Is that some kind of boat talk?
I mean don't you trust her?
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
What?
What?
Just waiting for you sweetie.
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Really?
Your mother told you this?
I bet this will work!
Ow!
Haven't we made this decision?
Our guy's a great dancer!
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
What?
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Yeah, no, me neither.
Right.
His dancing partner?!
You're an opthamologist.
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Yeah, yeah.
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Give them to me.
Well, thanks anyway.
I warned you...
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Let go!
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Nooo!
Hey!
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
What?! What are you doing?!
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
I'm just easing you in.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Why would you do that?
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Gin.
Yeah. Where were you?
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
No he's not!
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
How's the big anniversary dinner?
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
That's probably what they'll say.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Uff.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Okay.
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
No it's not, it's second.
That other play?
He didn't ask me to marry him.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
I know!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
You just wanna each take one?
Yeah! Richard!
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
You serious?!
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
No.
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Do you all promise?
Hey!
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Why not?!
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Who are you talking too?
That's a good idea.
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Did I squeeze it too hard?
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Woo-hoo, stuud!
Oh, you're a grandpa.
What?
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
We have got to wash that!
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Chandler what do you say?
Cups.
No, she's out shopping.
It's nice.
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
Oh, Larry.
Oh, sorry.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Honey, we gotta go!
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Okay.
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Huh?
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
I know.
You got a callback too didn't you?
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Oh, yeah.
What?!
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Ross, are you okay?
Shut up, I'm happy.
Really?
You came?!
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
I wa-
Hello.
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
What baby?
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Thank you. They're yours.
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
Mom, I'm hungry.
Nighty-nite.
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Cause I already invited her.
Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Just come.
You bet.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
What's this?
You're not supposed to look!
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
It's Monica, open up!
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Then all your stuff would be here.
He doesn't have anyone.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
What?! Excuse me!
Joey, promise me something.
Five more and I'll flash you.
If you want.
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
I think so too.
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
Why would the little girl creep you out?
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
I'm outa here.
Okay.
Y'know what? You are right?!
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
What's 'pleh'?
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
He asked you out?!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
So how's it going with you guys?
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Why do you do it?
But you've only slept with two people.
Oh my god good?
Hi!
Oh my God!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Rach, why won't they take it back?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Ross's parents are my parents!
Keep talkin'.
Alright.
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
That is so funny. Let me see that.
Deal!
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
He's totally flirting with you too.
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
What did you say?
Yes!
Mmmm! It's good!
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Come on Ben.
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
I'm really not deciding!
Never done that before.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
He could hear me.
Soakin' up all the culture.
Okay.
What?!
Yeah, am I in it?
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
You painting his toenails?
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
So what are you gonna be?
Ooh, and I can do this.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
New York.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
No way!
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
But my apartment!
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Okay, ready?
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
What?
NOW!!!!!!!!
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Well then we still have a problem.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Okay.
Why?!
Oh and you know what I want!
Okay. Four.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Then why would he say it?
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Yes.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
I'll be right there!
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
No.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
There was nudity!
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
No I don't.
Hi Steve!
You'd better run!
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
I can't believe we're living here!
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
About a half an hour.
Sit down.
What is wrong with you?!!!
No, give me the...
Yes?
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
To the bank.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Ohh.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
God, you are so strong.
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Oh! You're awake!
They're green?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Just some stuff for the party.
So she's a woman! So what?
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Ross, the heat!
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Well what did you send?
Sure, I love this part!
Wow.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Do you know what's a bad idea?
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Could not be more terrified.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Joey!
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
What?
No, just a Friday night.
Bye Dan!
Hey.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Okay.
We both do that!
Okay. I suck!
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
Yeah! Oh yes!
Here's your key
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
You okay?
You bought a boat?
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
And the sex?
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Hi!
I think it's romantic.
Ross will do it.
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Okay great!
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Joey that is horriable.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
That's very funny!
What?!
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Then why are you smoking?
Chandler! What are you doing here?
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Don't say it.
Sure.
Hi.
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
So what're you gonna do?
What about these? These look the same?
I did.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Fine!
Rach, come see who's out here!
Where have you been?
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
I am not.
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
How are you still single?!
Hey Pheebs!
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
When did I sign for it?
Phoebe!
What?!
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
So I'm kissing everyone?
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I see pizza!
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Mine? Right here?
Dad!
Thanks.
This doesn't feel weird!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
I hate men! I hate men!
It's coming from the living room.
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
I gave you a key for emergencies!
You're doing it again.
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Ross isn't here.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
You're Lewis Posin.
Ross, cough drops, please?
Makes me wanna puke!
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
We'll put buckles on it.
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
No, it's more like a good luck.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
What did they do to you?
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Are you sure?
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Wafer thin ice!
Christmas cookie?
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Yeah!
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Chandler.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
I was in too much pain.
Okay...who are you?
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
I was kidding.
No really, they're OK.
Of course.
Paris?
That's true.
Well, we certainly are alone.
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Hang on a second I just got in.
No really, they're OK.
How's it going?
It's Joey's birthday.
Hey! There you are!
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Chandler!!
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Let me ask you a question.
Wow.
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
What's the matter?
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Hey, aren't you up next?
Here!
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Isn't that great?
Where's that?
What?! You're going out with her again!
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Well?
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Mmmmm.
That's great!
Well, you're-you're sweating.
Are you alright?
Really?
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
What did you just say?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
Oh, from who?
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
Thank you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
Oh?
Hi.
Yesss!!
How'd the lecture go?
Joey!
What happened to Janine?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
No, I just talked to them.
Oh, really?!
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Hey sweetie!
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
What?!
Okay, can we please go eat?
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
Yeah.
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Ross!
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Aww...
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Okay, you're fine.
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
I can't go to lunch!!
Regular or decaf?
What?
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
Why do you need it?
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Okay. Here's the thing.
I feel terrible, I really do.
Demi Moore is not a he.
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Why do I have to decide?
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Ross, we can handle this.
What!?
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
I'm sorry.
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Huh?
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
Wasn't there a little song?
So, how'd it go?
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Why?
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
And some of us really have to pee.
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
It might be kinda cool.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Really? I only had two glasses.
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
Is he not cute enough for you?
Okay fine, now Ross...
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
It's almost our anniversary!
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Alright, check.
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Or incredibly offensive.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
Why don't you just take it with you?
Forget it.
I love you, Pete!!!
It was a really beautiful service.
What?!
Hey, what's up?
Shut up.
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Joey! You didn't even know her!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
Okay, here comes another camera.
Give me that!
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
Yes.
Nothing.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
Hey!
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
Honey, I'm sorry.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Not now.
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Hi.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Hey there.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
And that would be?
Yeah!
Well, why would she lie to you?
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
I was probably waiting for it to open.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Quit flicking
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Hi, honey.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Hey!
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Hello.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Okay.
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Yes, you did!
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Oh.
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
What's the part?
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Did you just flick me?
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Chandler!
Oh, is everything in the car?
No.
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
In like a half-hour?
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Well, she saw the ring.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Score! Now can we go?
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
That's right. Did you hear something?
Well yeah.
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Me too.
Nooo!!
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
What are you doing with those?!
No.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Yes!!
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
It's Danny.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Okay. I love you so much.
Are you serious?
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
You're so efficient. I love you!
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
And you're cute too.
Chandler!
Yeah.
Oh that's great!
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
One!
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
You flicked me first.
Oh!
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
You realize what you are don't you?
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Who is this?
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Yeah?
I don't want a beer.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
No, you cannot.
What?!
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
All right, I...I have to ask.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Uh, Ross.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Stick out your tongue.
Mr. Heckles.
Ready!
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Oh my God!
I know, but look at me all tan.
Judy.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
And processing.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
All right.
I will.
Please! I made this game what it is.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Ready? Wrestle!
Hey!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
I can't promise anything.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Uh, good.
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Does it involve clogs?
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Chandler!!
Yeah.
Hey, where is everybody?
All right.
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Ah!
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Weren't you nine?!
Yeah?
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Joey!
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
I got you the foot massager.
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Joey!
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Jeffery.
That is so sweet!
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
OK.
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Where's your bed?
All right!
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
Yeah.
Oh, please.
You know Paul?
Oh, no!
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Don't worry about it.
Oh my God!
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Hey!
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
Really?
That's okay.
Oh.
Oh.
It's good to see you
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Really?
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Or Spin the Bottle?
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Ooh, nice.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
I know!!
Chandler?
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Did you make brownies today?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
Oh my God, Richard.
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
This isn't even my dress.
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Thanks.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
And you're not gonna do that.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Well, what did you do?
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Hey!
How did it go?
Phoebe!
I think he's shy.
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
I'm sorry but...nothing.
Yes!!
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Here's your tea Phoebe.
And yet, we're still poking him.
Do you think he knew I was here?
Oh my.
Yeah?
Isn't this great?
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
What-what's going on?
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Oh God! I gotta go!
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Poor thing!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Hi, Geoffrey.
you don't have insurance?
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Here you go. You can wear this.
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
We have a ladle.
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Hey, Phoebe!
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Still, I was quick as a cat.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
I'm so happy for me.
Really? Why?
Ah, yeah!
Thank you soo, much.
They were lovers.
Yeah, me too.
It's so good, isn't it?
A couple of days.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Why else would we be here?
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Okay.
Sorry Joey
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Water rules!
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
We haven't eaten yet!
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Or! A bakery delivery person.
You were invited?!
That noise you just made?
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
What's a 'niffle'?
I promise.
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Ohh.
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Oops.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
How-how did that happen?
What are you trying on now?
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
What? I-I said you had a-
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
It's 9:30 in the morning!
Hey!
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Okay. I-I can't watch.
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
This is all of your things.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
What if they don't?
Was it...
So do them for free.
Hey!
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Yeah.
What are you doing?!
No you robot!!
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
I mean really, think about it.
Michael.
Does so count!
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
What?!
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Oh my God! You're water broke!
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
I know.
I just... can't do it.
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Why not?
Hey.
Joey!
Hey.
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
You really ok with it?
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
What?
Oh boy me too!
I am good. I finished my book.
Ooh, this always happens.
Excellent!
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Are you alone?
Duh-huh!
Yeah.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
All right then.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
What are you crazy?!
We're with you. We got it.
What?
Yeah. You!
Take care.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
No, seriously.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Whaaat!
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
Wow! You are really fast!
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Yeah.
So, did you do it?
She will be after tonight.
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
There's only one.
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Yeah!
Oh shut up!
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
No way!
I am!!
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Alright, we have to talk.
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Hi.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
We're not doing anything.
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
I got it!
All right then. Bye.
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
Hi, nice to meet you!
Noo!!!
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
So how was Joan?
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Joey!!
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
You had a salad.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Was he crying?
Why would I have the keys?
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
Yeah, well they suck too.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Yay!
That's right.
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
Hi.
Only here.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Ross, can I?
That's not even a game!
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
I'm crying here!!
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Really?
What are you doing?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Okay.
Yeah, it's great.
What about your breath?!
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
Really?
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
We're hanging out.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Isn't he an architect now?
Yeah. It's Dutch.
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Congratulations!
Pick a number! That is your only job!
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
You know, a party, or--
No, I just, I fell down.
What? I don't see anything.
What?! Oh.
I...
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Fat?!
No! Oyster?
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Well, you're not working either.
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Unless...
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Fine, go have sex.
What are you doing?
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Okay.
You are?
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Nestle Tollhouse?!
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Too strong for me?
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Pass the cheese, please.
Hey!
That's so gross!
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
I love you!
Once!!
Hey.
What kinda things have you been saying?
What about the part where he has rabies?
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
Oh, put him on!
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Come here, I want to show you something!
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
Why not?
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Why?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Does it involve travel?
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Would you please go?
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
He's... our age.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Hey!
Great. So the ball is in his court?
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
What kind of karate is that?
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
He hates to lose.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Oh!
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Hey, how long are you in the city?
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
You just asked me.
It's kind of an important one!
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Claws?!
Oh, thank you.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
What's with all this sand?
Thanks.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
And the way she slaps all the time!
I told you not to go down there!
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Ross.
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Come on Rach, let's go.
Oh.
I wish all guys could be like him.
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
What happened?
You'll vamp?!
I know.
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
You sold me out.
I blame London.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
Oh my God!
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
I'll take care of it.
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Are you mocking me?
That is wild.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Yeah, it did.
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
You have other friends?
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
I lost our mattresses.
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Pete's breaking up with me.
Help yourself.
After the snap!
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Well, we certainly are alone.
Thank you.
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
He's gonna eat the cake!
Licorice?
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
You owe me 20 bucks.
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Thanks again.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
Hi!
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
How have you been?
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
How'd you pay for them?
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
What?
Did that!
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
What took you so long?
Oh my God!
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
Hey!
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
Hey!
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
I know!
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
What were we thinking?
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Oh, wait a minute honey.
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Yes!
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Yep! You got the tickets?
I don't have an atlas.
What?!
Last night.
Fine!
Okay, you ready to open yours?
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Really?
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
I loved them!
All right, you!
We're good.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
I don't want things to change! Do you?
You just carry that around?
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
What?
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Oh my God!
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Yeah, sure.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
That sounds like Nana.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Not at these prices.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Bye.
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Wow, this really sucks.
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Oh, honey, the earrings...
I do?
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Okay!
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Don't do what?
Yes!
What happened?
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Come on, we can't let them win!
I'll be right back.
You're meeting Richard?
Phoebe!
I'm sorry..
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Great...
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
What?!
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
...What did I ask?
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Oh, then go Vassar.
No.
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
We all chipped in.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
Rach, did you check the machine?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Nope.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
I made them!
Larry?
Why?!
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
I like that. What?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Oh well, where is he?!
I never knew that either.
Bye.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
How did work go?
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Okay.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Hi.
What are you talking about?
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
You have got to go home!
What kind of changes?
She's right there.
Oh no, wait! Joey!
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
Come on!
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
So what happened?
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
It's for their own good.
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Wow, what?
Oh yeah. Definitely.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Are you okay?
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Mm-hmm.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Can you go any faster with that?
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
That's right.
Hi Mr....Bing.
I-I-I think you look great.
Only if you say his full name.
Absolutely.
Oh my God it's old!
Damn! It's empty!
I know.
You didn't even take off your pants.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
All right.
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Between you and...
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
What uh-What did you-What?!
Please!
There's my little boy.
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Joey, this is you!
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Huh, wanna bet?
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
In case it happens.
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
You can spill. In the sink.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
The players.
For what?
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
What is it?! What about Pete?
Nah, I got it.
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Chandler!
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Who are they killing off?
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Aww, man!
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
And slept with the professor.
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Okay.
Ross, there he is.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Do you always have to bring him here?
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Yay!
Really?!
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
What do you say?
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Rachel said everything was okay.
We're gonna see each other naked.
Or 45.
They're still in my coat.
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
What are you the memory woman?
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
It's hard for some people!
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Who is it?
No drops!
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
No! You can't do that!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Because the winner gets this!
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
Phoebe?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
What did you say?
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
No! No!
Hey guys.
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
I'm Monica.
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Got me.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Hey!
Hey! I didn't know either.
Not now, I'm sick!
What?!
The Richard.
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Thank you.
How was that possible?
How's it going?
I know. Thanks.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Noooo!!!!
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Ross!!!
I would love to do it together!
Have you seen Chandler?!
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
It's a diaper commercial.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
I'm fine.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
No.
Nothing.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Ohh, absolutely.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Yeah, but without the costumes.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Yes.
As much as they love you?
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
What are you doing?
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Break!
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Okay, I freaked out a little.
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Hey!
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Why not?!
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
Yes it's true.
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Did you smoke?
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
But you live here! You know that.
Really?!
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Where ya going?
That's me.
I'll call you back.
My parents will be so happy.
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Pheebs?
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Hi!
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Awwwww...
Wait, wait, wait!
Yeah!
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Sorry, Rach.
Does anybody want these?
Yeah, we really do!
I don't want a cat!
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
Men are such idiots.
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
Phoebe that's crazy!
Oh.... my... God.
No it's not.
Yes!
You made it!
Hi...May I help you?
Did you like it?
Oh, So you can move them!
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Well, thanks.
Just the matter of ...payment?
Oh.
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
Like?
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
That counts!
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Oh, here's a great one.
Go on.
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Hm-hmm!
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
What is it?
Okay!
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
I know why!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Have you found your dress yet?
Are you crazy?!
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
...I can imagine.
So the going for help went well?
All right, what about the third guy?
'I drink tea.'
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Tomorrow!
This is Rachel.
My brother, Ross.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
That was you?
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
No time for that!
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Yes!!
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Could you not look?
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Okay. Umm...
And it's a magnet!
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Alright.
Okay!!
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
No.
How?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Ow!
Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
And I have costumes.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Had it.
Okay.
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
I never stop thinking about it.
Hi.. how was the game?
Nothing.
Yes.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
So what's Phoebe like?
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
I make the decisions, and I say no.
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
But, we pick again! We pick again!
You al-you already had it?
So'd you guys have fun?
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Hormones.
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
Another good point.
Hey.
So, where do you want to go?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Lots of responses.
Oh God!
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Oh, you're right.
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
What are you doing?
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
Did you like learn about her family?
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Oh.
Yes?
And well, what did she say?
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Oh my God!
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
I am 26.
Yes!
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Okay.
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
What do you mean?
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
You okay?
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
It's not your birthday.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
What's goin' on?
Emily Waltham.
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
No Phoebe I am mad!
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
All right, we should call somebody.
We're switching rooms again.
I was laughing.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Yeah!
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Ohh!
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
"See you around?"
I am so jealous.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Ross? Let's go.
Of course!
Are you sure?
That's my pie!
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Say you're sorry.
That was gonna be my opener.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Hey! How was it?
Stupid.
You don't have the guts.
Yeah, Ginger something.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
I don't want a ghost.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Hmm?
Hi, honey.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Are you okay?
Hi.
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
What?
Okay.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
I know! I know! I know!
I got it!!
I'm fine.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
That's that weird voice again.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
In.
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
What's hard to believe?
Think about it.
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Happy birthday!!!
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Uh-huh!
Really?!
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Thank you.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
I can do that!
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
You have dinosaur checks?
Well so?
Rachel!
Oh God.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Okay.
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Don't say it!
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
What?
And ice!
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
Hi.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
She sent the chicken back again?!
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Hi.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
I was.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
What have I not told you?
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
All right, you ready?
Joey!
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Here we go again.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
How do you feel?
Rach, here's your mail.
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
That is never good.
All right, I'll try not to.
We won't. 300?
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
'I am Bea.'
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Oh my god.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
How do you feel?
Have you even had a girl up here?
Joey, what's going on?
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Here you go.
What?
What is that?
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
What are you doing?
I can't do it!
I'll pick it up for you!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Phoebe!
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Hey!
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Hi!
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh well, it's not so bad.
What are you doing?
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
I am, aren't I?
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Hey.
What?!! What?
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Sure.
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
That's Bill Clinton.
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Hey!
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Nope, she's perfect.
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Hey!
You too.
I read to you.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Okay, I'll go!
Hi Chandler.
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
You are so cute.
Where were your parents?
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
What's this?
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Very!
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
You're not gonna mess it up.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
Yes, they can stay with us.
That's true.
I mean, was it Gina?
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Well, uh, I ate some.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
That's your call.
Lucky bastard! Janice.
Thank you.
And he's a great brother!
Okay, good luck!
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
You had no relationship!!
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
You did not go!
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Why not?
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
We, we just wanna see the end.
Well it didn't!
Then why are you laughing?
Hey!
I blame London.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
I'm not laughing.
OK. Just for a little while.
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
I like 'em.
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
Unless...
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Alright.
So have you called her yet?
Isn't that mine?
It's Richard Burke.
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Yeah.
Really?!
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Hate that guy!
Noo!! Okay!!
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
What's tonight?
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Oh my God.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
I thought she just had one.
Really?
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Well...I'd better get going.
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
Come on! Chandler!
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Really?
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Actually, I did!
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
No! I'm not okay!
Ow!
Okay, in we go.
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
That's stealing!
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Hey!
Look at this.
You love me!
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Nooo!
It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Well, it just seems that...
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Edward Nevski?
Yep, yep...You?
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Hey.
What's Phase Two?
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Something to remember me by!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
We didn't give you any money!
Honey, there's a reason.
What!!?
Uh-oh, it was bad?
Oooh!
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
I know. I need more pie.
Joey!!
We checked. A lot.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Sooo?
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
And Monica knows...
You gave her food poisoning!?
Oowww!!
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
You can, I know you can!
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
No.
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
What?
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
What?!! Gross!!
Continue.
Joey, I'm in!
Wow! You made a profit!
Nothing, I don't know.
I'm really gonna miss you.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Great!
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Uh-huh.
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
About what?
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
No.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
That you're a liar.
I love you too Chandler.
There's a game?
I like them a lot.
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Oh my.
Why did you hire me?
How?
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Hmm?
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Alright, you wanna feel better?
I've gotta get back in the game.
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
I saved you a seat.
Everybody knows!
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
What?!
Bye sweetie, I love you.
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Oh my God!
Wow.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Oh, God forbid.
Oh no!
Huh?
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
Can you blame him?
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Bobby.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
A-ha!!!
Chandler!
What?
Oh, yeah.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
I have no idea what you just said.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
I'm in the shower!
What?
This bottle opener.
God, what is wrong with me.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Oh, we have some...
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Okay.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Oh, good.
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
What if they get mixed up?
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
I'm outa here.
Thank you.
I heard that!
Oops.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
What is DOOL?
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
What's going on?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Saucy!
Oh, I-I don't know.
Thank you so much Phoebe.
Don't come in here!
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
I really need to talk to you.
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Me going out with Richard's son.
You look cute in bubbles.
So it's okay to date a student.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
No!
A mirror?
Hello.
Well, you're not.
Well, maybe you don't need them.
Did you two...
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Yes!
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
How much?
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
Oh God!
Well, bye for me too.
Hi!
Put all my money in me.
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
What are you talking about?
Whoa! Are you okay?
So we're back on?
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Hi!
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
How do you do that?
Yeah, I do know.
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Hey, I went up.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
No! You have lasagnas!
I know!!!
You don't have any stuff.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Okay!
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Okay, come here!
Yeah right.
-leg?
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Okay.
C'mon up.
No!
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
What?!
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Oh my God! What happened?
I can't believe you did that.
Oh, no no no no no.
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Hey guys!
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Wow.
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
You can let some of them go by!
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Break.
Please!
Oh my God!
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Thanks!
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Noo!!
I know it is the best.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Wow!
All right, what's goin' on?
Two!
Do you have a plan?
Oh Joey!
Bunny!
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Oh, why?
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
You can not do this.
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Thank you.
Yeah, definitely!
Of course!
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Your favorite!
All right, let's go say good-bye.
You're gonna what?
Really?
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Hey!
For what?
Run, Phoebe, run!
What the hell are you doing?!
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Megan!
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Then I won't have to kill you.
You could do that!
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Rach?
Hexadrin.
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Sit down! We're winning!
Are you okay?
Ha-ha!
God Ross, what is that?
But my clothes are-ohh!
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Hi guys!
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
What are you guys doing here?
That was me.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
I know, but you have to open it today!
Ethan?
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Did not.
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Hey! Good, you're home!
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
All right, you're hired!
And lucky means, more cleavage?
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
What's up?
Okay. That was her right?
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
How does she do that?
Oh!!
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Okay.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Hey!
Please, just a little bit off the back.
No, I will not cave.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Over here dad.
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
We're so sorry.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
No time for that!
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
What?
Gotta keep squishing.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
What?! What is it?
All right. Mmm-mmm.
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Come on eight.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Really!
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Old?
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Who the hell are you?!
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
We'd love too.
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
Okay.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
No.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
Say it.
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Morning.
Hey. Where's Joey?
What are you smiling at?
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
What? We could do it!
Joey!
We're sorry honey.
We're switching rooms.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
No, sorry.
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Let go!
Why?
Okay, bye.
Oh, my pleasure.
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Hi.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
That's much better.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
About what?
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
All right.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
You thought about that?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
But we can go, right?
Well, how bout just her mom?
The baby shower for Phoebe!
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
That counts!
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Bye.
I love you, too.
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Yes!
What?
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Joey!
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
Ohhhh!
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Just uh, do the right thing.
My God! Is this a gym card?
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Okay.
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
I think you're better than you think you are.
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Janice?!
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Come on.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
Then all your stuff would be here.
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
Was it really that good?
From here to the airport?
Hey!
Hey! You're wearing pants!
I can't believe you let them win!
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
OK, um. Goodbye.
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
What kinda stuff?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Oh, y'know..
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
Oh my God! I love him!
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Jody!
Them?! Who's them?
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
No, no, I don't.
Oh, they-they sent me home.
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Oh my God!
So! He'll understand!
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
No you didn't.
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
I gave you one job!
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
That's right.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Yes I do!
You used to have carpet.
No that's, that's okay.
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
What?
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Yes, you are so smart!
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
I thought that was a good thing.
Big time!
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
That's a good call. Right.
Wow!
Bye.
Sorry, Phoebe.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Including me?
I guess they're back from their date.
Ow!!
There you go!
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
What's the matter?
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
What the hell is this?
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Come on! I really need your help!
What are you talking about?
I got it!
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Hi, come on in.
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Some moms do that.
Who's Denise?
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Hi.
See he's nice. Right?
Me too.
Hello?
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Me too!
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Oh, yeah, right.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Losers walk!
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
All right.
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
No.
Do you mind telling us what it is?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Yeah baby!
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Maybe.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Okay.
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
Eh, you work for that.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Good for you, Joey.
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
Is Joey here?
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Then why did you move?!
Hey!!
So are you ok?
That was unbelievable!
Okay, this one I like!
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Hey.
Uh-hmm.
Don't you have to pee?
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Yes.
I am the best.
One.
Hey guys.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Hi!
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Thunder being stolen!!
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
She's bluffing!
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
007 gets all the ladies.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
dammit!
I know!!!
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Good night!
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Changes?
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
Yeah?
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
It's not mayonnaise!!
Sure.
You know!
We owe you?!
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Well, get it off now!
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
What is that?
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Why?
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Love is the best medicine.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
I knew you were not okay with that.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Well, didn't you?
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
I know!
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Oh...
Hold on.
All right, sorry.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
What?
'Scuse us
Yeah!
Not any more.
And who pays for that?
You stink!
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Rachel, that's all we do.
Hey.
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Man's got a point.
Hey sweetie.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
You gave my father a lap dance!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
Say you're sorry.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
Huh.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Naked?
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
There were only twelve.
You guys, I am not that bad!
So, what do you think we should do?
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Oh yeah.
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
That is sooo not true!
Please.
Hi.
We should go.
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
Hey umm, what's this?
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
You're kidding! Where? Where?
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
I'm sorry?
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
I'm gonna miss you!
Okay, fine.
How desperate am I?
You're plans were with us.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Uh-huh, that one!
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Me and Chandler?!
You did it! You got ordained?!
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Like a log.
Hello, people who do not live here.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
I think you're my favorite.
Oh, thank you!
Sure.
No. Why?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
Outside.
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
They have racquets don't they?!
Why is everything different?
Here, take a couple of these.
Hey.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
That's not a question.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
That really was some of your best work.
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Put your head back.
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
What?
Would it really have been that easy?
Go! Go! Go!
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Oh... shoot.
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
YES!!!!!!!!
Yeah.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
This is my favorite part.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Vividly.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Are you serious?!
Why? Do you have a report due?
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
What else did you think about?
Anybody lose this?
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Chandler.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
I'm gonna set them to my time.
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
We are! Help us!
Now?
Hoyt?
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
You're not on TV.
Hi Ben!
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Hey!
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
No. No, thank you!
That's the couch.
Hi.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
Do you not see it?
Yeah.
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Oh no!
The wedding starts at six.
I hope she's OK.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Not necessarily...
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
What're you gonna do?
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
That is not true!
What?
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
What?!
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
I am loud!
Hey guys! Hey!
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Why did they get divorced?
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
What? It's still going on.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Oh, no thanks.
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Hi.
Aww! I love you!
How's it going with her?
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
What?! Which one?!
Joey look it's really sweet...
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
I can't! I have to work!
Really?
Oh my god.
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Yes that would be lovely.
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
What? Why, why would...
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Ross!
You're on the phone!
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
The only problem!
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Oh my God!
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
We'll talk later.
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Y'know what's weird?
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Hey!
That's fine.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
What's the matter?
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Really?
Shut up, and put my table back.
Please, have some!
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Oh, just until the glue dries.
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Hey!
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Hey.
Still smoking cigars?
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
I don't know.
Well you should be embarrassed.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
You have to go to London!
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Yeah.
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Why?
Hi.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
Yeah, it's good.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Well?
It's okay, it's okay.
And you?
Wow!
Why?
Oh God, yes!
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Great, now he's waving back.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
What a minute, what did he say?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
The best man? Wow!
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Come on!
No!
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
Well, what's the job?
I can't believe he did this.
What?
Really?!
I'm so happy for you!
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What's wrong with PBS?
No, you're the best.
Yes, is that okay?
Yeah, what is it?
You'll see.
Okay.
This is the most special day of our lives.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Hi Chandler.
You changed?
Hey!
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
Two girls and a boy?
'Kay, here you go.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
No. I hate this part.
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
The Luisa from home room!
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
But you told them you weren't?
Shut up!
You start working on that list.
Was it...?
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Really, is he a swimmer?
Something wrong?
Why not?
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
I have some pretty exciting news!
This is insane!
Well, what happened?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Hey!
Ready?
Bye.
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Because they'll know we've been listening.
Come on, no peeking!
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Really?!
1250.
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
Oh my God, it was incredible.
All right.
That doesn't seem fair.
Yes, you did!
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
So you're free Thursday, then.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
Phoebe, what is it?
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
The Bible?!
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Rachel's not here.
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Never call me from that phone.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Hey, the man's dog just died.
Really?
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
What?
5 6 7 8!
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
That, you get? That, you get?
How are you?
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
So, should I call him back?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
Are you serious?
I can't believe he did this.
And this goes for all guys?
Maye it's me.
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Oh my God!
That's the surprise!
Why is this car in my bedroom?
Why?
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
God, look what I found in the drain.
Who?
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
The show?!
Very bad.
No she hasn't.
Um-hmm.
Now calm down Joey.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Oh!
That's not gonna work.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Okay!
Did you break up with her?
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Um... hi there.
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Two.
No! We only mess around at his place!
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Pete.
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
And six others.
Every year.
It's like two miles!
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
What?!?!
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
What are you talking about?
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
Well, it's getting late.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
Hi!
No, I'm sorry.
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, Rachel!
I called him.
W-wait. What is that?
She's sleeping.
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Well no, but um.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
C'mon!
Okay.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Okay.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Rachel's at work.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Electrical plans for the building.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Ohh, how is he?
Rach?
Chandler!
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
That's it! Dinner is over!
We'll be waiting for you...
I'm a twinkie.
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
Phoebe?
Oh, here.
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
I'm afraid so.
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Please!!
What are you talking about?
Hi!
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Really.
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Sure.
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
Joey.
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
No.
Hey.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Oh, good luck.
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
You're going to China?
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
What?!
What?
Hi.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
This bicep?
Where?
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Really? My God, he's really cute.
What?
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
