Gimme an 'L!'
Why aren't you at work?
We're good?
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh that's okay.
Okay.
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Oh, look at the little cat!
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Hey.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Yeah.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
You're just staring into space.
Huh.
Are you kidding me?
Aw.
Oh.
I am not a pushover!
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, sure?
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Barry?
No! Joey!
Ok.
Sorry.
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Yeah.
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Hi.
Thank you.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
I'll figure something out.
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Chandler, what are you doing?
Ross's what?
Yeah?
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Sure.
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
I need to talk to you!
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Yes.
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Hm-m.
Pheebs...
Thank you.
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Ross.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
What's the matter?
Hey! What's up Mon?
You like me?
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
None for me.
I don't want to say.
How are you?
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Joey.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Really?
Okay.
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Great!
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Bathroom's up there.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
I know.
Yeah.
Saw what?
Okay.
Oh my God.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Hi!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
No.
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Yeah.
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Yes it is!
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Okay? Whoa, wait!
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
I really think you need to go now.
Because I lose her stuff!
Eh! Stop it!
Hey, Pheebs!
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Does anybody need more coffee?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Yeah.
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
Well, have fun!
That was not funny!
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Ohh, thank you.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Would you like some pancakes?
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Good luck to ya!
Mindy.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Yeah.
Hey!
Somebody got in late last night.
How is she?
Hi, Pheebs.
I guess you don't.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
You're welcome.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
OK.
Oh no!
Ohhh!!
And you know Monica and Ross!
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Have fun!
Sure.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
He is so cute!
Okay.
Phoebe!
Hey.
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
