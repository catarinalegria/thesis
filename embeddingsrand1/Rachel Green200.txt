I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Sure. You got it. Great!
Yeah, sure.
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
What?
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
I do.
Ohhh, OK.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
Almost.
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Why the voice.
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Why?
Hi.
Yeah right.
Let us keep the apartment and...
Good.
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
She asked-asked you out again?
Do you wanna play football?
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Yeah.
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Hi.
Uh-huh.
Well, h-how is this like that?
Can I see that for second.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
Really?!
Hello!
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Phoe-be!!
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
Oh, that's true.
It's the same story.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
I've got some bad news.
What?!
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Hi-e!!
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
What's going on?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
In a month?
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Did he call? Did Mark call?
I'm sorry.
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Well, thank you, Melanie.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
Hi!
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Do you guys want these?
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Um-hmm.
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
HI!! Hi!
All right, well how much time do you need?
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Thank you.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
A lot.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
I went really long.
You know what?
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
What?
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Because!
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Yeah, great, you betcha!
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
You stole the phone!
I know.
I know!
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Was that the cake?
And your fly's still open...
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Ahhhh....
Okay.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Go on! Go on.
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Okay.
Noooooooo!
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Hi!
Honey, this will help.
Oh, I did!
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Hey Joey!
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Are you gonna let me play?
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
I could not have done this without you.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Seriously, it's moving!
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
Noo! Angels.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
How did it go with Erin?
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Nothing?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Yeah, right. Sure!
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Monica.
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
You found my book?!
Not even with your best friend.
I cannot believe her.
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
I'm okay.
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
What?!
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Wha...
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
I did.
Well, I...
Uh-huh!
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Allll done!
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Wait a minute!
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Oh! Pathetic!
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
What?
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Okay.
Settle what?
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
So what happens next?
That's 'cause you have it.
Summer catalogue!
