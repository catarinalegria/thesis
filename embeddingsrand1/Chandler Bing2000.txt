I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Well it's very unsettling.
Hey!
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Yeah, we're gonna go.
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
Yeah.
Oh no-no-no-no!
No-no-Really?!
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Okay, okay, you got it!
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
What's the second part of your plan?
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
I just saw Janice.
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Ho! Ho! Ho!
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
You can tell us.
Here I am.
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Janice, you're--
And you're okay with that?
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
I will have one.
Oh my God!
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Yeah! You?
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Are you funny?
What did you just do?
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Uh, HELLO!!
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Oh. Oh, God!
Hi! How'd it go?
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
What, what are you laughing at?
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Could be Casey.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Yeah let's head off to work.
It's 6:00.
Where's Monica?
Heyyyy-What?
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
What?
So, we gettin' a fish?
You slept with the stripper?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
You okay there man?
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Right.
Yeah!
What's going on?
Richard!
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Batman has a utility belt!
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Hey!
Know what I mean?
Joey you broke my chair!!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Chandler.
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
In a foreign, romantic country...
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
You mean the spitter?
Where's my seat belt?
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Hey!
Dude that is so sad.
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Hey!
You're welcome.
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Why not?!
Hi.
Ehh.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
What's this?
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
We can't accept this.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Hi.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Ok.
See? Here we go.
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Hike!
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
Joey's a sex addict.
Oooh that may be a New World's record
Basically we just feel that he's...
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Hello!
You do know that Wham broke up?
Okay, fine, $300.
...Dinah?
What?
What do we do? What do we do?
Hey!
Can you hear that?
Can I just say one thing?
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Who's he huggin'?
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
Oh, ok.
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Hey.
Sure!
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Yes.
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Ahh, third base.
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Our next cocktail party?
You have no trouble telling time now right?
I said, "Like what?"
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Oh my God.
It came up.
No, no he went for a walk.
Yeah you can do it.
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Hey Phoebe!
Oh, you're-you're going?
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
You wanna hug it out?
Why not?
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
It's your timer.
Love your condoms my man.
Oh, I can't go.
Yeah?
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
What-what 'cha doin'?
Fun's over!
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
So I got ya something.
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Huh.
No?
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Centerpieces!
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
Damn Rollos!
Rach...
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
All right, I'm nine years old.
So you're really okay with this?
You're right.
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Hey!
It's my joke.
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Why not?!
That's what you should say.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
You betcha!
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Oh God!
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Uh, yes, yes it is.
Hey.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
Hey!
This is not going to work.
That's what you got me?
Howdy.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
Oh, ok.
What?
Well, we are great guys.
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
I could die.
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Hey, Janice.
All right, call it in the air.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Hi.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Totally worth it!
Seriously?
And I think Ross is generous too.
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
Not really.
Oh, you get used to it.
Condoms, dude!
It's Clint! Clint!
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
Again?
How do ya do.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
What?
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Monica's wasted.
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
And there's daddy!
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
I-I think we have too.
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
....with??
The young hot ball and chain.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
OK, this one right here is from me.
Yes!
Oh all right.
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Well, I guess that's something.
Please tell me you got the message!
Oh!
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
You're building a post office?
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Hi.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Condoms?
You understood that?
Wow umm, calm down.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Yep, I'm in a tree.
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
You didn't just break up.
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
It was my racquet.
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
I don't know.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Thank you, Joey.
Come on, let me see that smile.
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Oh my God!
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Do you know what just happened?
No, you're the best.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Ross, ten o'clock.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
And now I've picked it up again.
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
He thought you said gonad.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Go.
Phil.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
You gotta do it, man.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
You're kidding.
Why?
So what happened?
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Yeah.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Do either of you have the keys?
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
It was the ring!
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Nice!
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Rachel lost Marcel.
Oh, yay...
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Joey!
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
It must take you forever to find your keys.
You think?!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
What about that circled one?
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Bye!
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Mustached bastard...
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Well, I feel like a snack!
Okay.
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
That's right.
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Aah, y'killing me!
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
First of the month.
We can talk about that.
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
It's like this, me, no jokes.
Yeeeeahhhh.
Nice work my friend.
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
What was that?
Althea?! What are you doing?!
Okay.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Ok.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Why?
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
We came over as soon as we saw.
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Yes, but for the last time.
All right! Bring it on, you...
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Okay!!!!!
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Okay, so he's out of here.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Are you serious?
And that's how you bought it?
Ohh!
Heads it is.
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Sounds like a fun party.
Yeah.
No, there were two.
The one that doesn't.
I'm not Jewish, so...
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Ni-hi-ice!
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Oh, that was my work laugh.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Janice?
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Nine.
How do you not fall down more?
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Ye-e-es!!
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Really?!
Seven times!
I KNEW IT!!!!
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
Hey, that was really good!
Hey.
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
Kick save and... denied.
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Nice save.
WHAT IS IT?!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
All right.
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
I would really love it if could do both.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Yeah.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
What? What?
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Ross.
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
What?
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Central Perk?
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
I think it's the dying cat parade.
No I didn't!
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Okay!
Die Hard still great!
There is not one hair on that head.
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
All right.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Well there you go.
Really?
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Well, close to...
Well this one's for you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
So-You got in voluntarily?!
Why not?
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Oh my God!
I've found.
Huh! Where is the dog?!
You don't know?
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Bye!
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Okay.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Man, this is...
Feelings, such strong feelings.
Any contact?
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Are you all right?!
Okay!
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
Really.
Oh my God!
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Okay!
You sure?
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Dying people say the craziest things.
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Oh.
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
What? Nothing.
Congratulations.
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
What are you doing out there?
Sure.
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
That's still in there?!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Here we go! Here we go!
OK.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
They got a breakfast buffet.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
OK, let's do it. What?
Oh, aaaah!
Mar-haaaan.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Yes.
Yes, Bunny?
Too dry.
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
No, you're the best.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Hey.
Nope.
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Oh no, no, no, no.
Oh come on you big faker!
Well that would help the pride thing.
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Could I be more sorry.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Oh, I don't know.
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Really?!
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
You remember Janice.
I was not and oh God, shh!
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Staying out of the way.
And the bunny got away.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
I'll give up my ticket.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Consider Casey.
Fine.
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
Okay.
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Yeah.
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
Oh my God!
I'm right here!
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
You okay?
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Yes.
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
...Quality, right, great.
She's just doing her job!
The man is showing brain.
Well that's a full cup!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Man, she is really gullible.
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
What are you doing here?
What did you do when they found out?
You're okay there?
I'll catch you guys later.
Hey, mister tux!
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Okay.
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Hey-hey!
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Had the money in the wrong hand.
It means we're holding hands.
And Milton Berle has a...
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
You are so great! I love you!
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Hey.
Mon, get out here!
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Tyrannosaurus!
Hmm.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Hey.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
I sure did.
Did she freak out?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
But we should take it.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Okay.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Hi! How are you?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Skull?
I know, I can do this.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Noo!
If it helps, I could slide over.
Would you please get some rest!
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Hey!
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Ok.
What's your point?
Hi Joey's sisters!
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Why am I looking?
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Do you want me to call?
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Okay. Okay.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Lose the other guys.
Are you all right?
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
I just wan't to...
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Is it--?
I am proud of all my friends today.
Hey.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Hey!
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
It's not charity, Joe...
I want you to say that you like her!
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
No, not us... Us!
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Umm, yeah.
I made a...
That's a low one!
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Phoebe.
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Sorry!
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
What does it say?!
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Three!
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
How's your room Rach?
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Okay.
No you know I don't mind.
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Okay, we owe you a present.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
It's my joke.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Nope, not this time.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Oh my God!
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
Yeah, check out the ring.
Yeah?
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
And now you're giving me the message!
Yeah?
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Oh man!!
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Oopsey, missed it!
Yes!
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
That's a good call. Right.
All right!
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
Did you not understand the story?
Oh thanks.
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Easy Lenny.
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
We're very happy for you.
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
How do you do that?
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
FREE PORN!!!
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Yes, I realise that.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Marcel?
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Yes!
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Good luck!
Cupping.
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Yep, pretty much.
What the hell is going on?!
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Hey!
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
I didn't know that.
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
Yes?
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
What?
All right, let's show them how it's done.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
There he is!
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Man, I gotta get a kid.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
And this- is my reward!
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Joe?
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
Yeah, okay.
Pirates again?
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
At a fake game!!
Hey!
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Thanks.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Well this is just sad!
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Oh.
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
You do? Why?
There you are.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
It's up to you.
"Big guy?"
Yeah!
There you go!!
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
And then Joey remembered something.
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
What am I gonna do, huh?
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Forget it, that's off.
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Hey.
Thank you.
So what are you gonna do?
You're naked in this picture!
Hey!
Well, can I just...
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Okay, here we go.
Yes, he is!
BEND OVER?!!!
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
No-no
Let me try it on!
Yeah?
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Morning, Ross.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Oh, well thank you in advance.
There's no back to this couch!
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
Janice is gonna go away now.
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
What?
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
That new mountain bike?
Well, I like danger.
Can I uh see something?
Bob here.
Great! Okay, here.
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Oh-I don't know.
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
It's my joke.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Hi there.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Yeah me too.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Oh come on!!
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
You gotta let me slam the door!
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Yes, I am!
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
I got glasses!
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
And is this in case the house sneezes?
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
The key's stuck in the lock.
...He's in.
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Hey!
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
So how'd it go?
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Hey!
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
What just happened?
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Ehh.
Beam me up Jesus.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Hey.
It's not a real game! I made it up!
Ohhh.
I know I am.
I know!!
Okay.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Yeah?
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Perfect decibel.
Hey, sweetums.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Oh my... God?
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
OK.
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Hey!
We are. He's meeting us here.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
What's going on?
I'm still on London time, does that count?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Eh?
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
It's a buffet man.
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Hey.
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
But I love swing music!
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Ahh-hahaha!
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
You mean scared.
That was Joey!
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
So will I.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Hey!
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
You said...
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Borrow money from me?
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Absolutely.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Hey.
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
I said art lover.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Thank you, buddy.
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
Too bad, she's leaving.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Oh my God! Oh my God!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
No?
Why?
Your work makes me sad.
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Air hole! Air hole!!
See you later.
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
What?
I know!
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Who said anything about Christmas?
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
You don't even have a car!
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
I think you smell great!
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
What is going on here?
Sorry!
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
It doesn't say that. Does it?
So, what do you thing the good news is?
No I didn't!
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
I'm sorry!
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Oh my God!!
Very informative!
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Thank you.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Hey!
I see.
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Hey, Mon.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
I don't want to say.
OK.
Good night.
Okay, hating this.
Hey.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Yeah?
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Well where... Where did she go?
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Theyre twins!
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
All right! Let's do it!
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
What?
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
No sir.
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
We are bad people.
Wh-wh-why?!
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Hi.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Stop what?!
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
We can't do this.
Oh, hello Rachel.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
Is that a problem?
I've had a very long, hard day.
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Yeah.
What check thing?
Yeah!
Okay!
Hey!
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Well, I, I should go in there.
No!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Hey!
Chandler.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Isn't that Ross's money?
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
I've got canned goods.
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
What? What?
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
What? Why?
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Uh-oh.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
Hey, yo.
What?
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Hey!
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
You knew about this?
Hey.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Oh, so that's what this is for.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Oh that's great! Good for you.
I don't care, she slept with me.
What's the matter honey?
How do you know?!
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
What?
I can't believe I ruined this.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
The reason he just said.
Okay man.
Okay.
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Robert's coming out.
The British are coming?
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Hi!
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
All right, ready?
Oh yes!
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Thanks.
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
Really?
You said no right?!
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
You don't have it.
No!
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
One more game?
You're kidding right?
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
What are you guys talking about?
I don't know.
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
...And what did you bring?
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
I don't want to look.
Uhhhaahh.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Couldn't be more out.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Hey, gorgeous.
Well, I just...
Takin' that with you, huh?
Come on in.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Nono, just you.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
No!
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Right.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
What?!
Well there you have it!
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
Uh, uh.
Aww, thanks man.
Yeah baby!
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
There you go! There you are!
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Ohhh. Don't go.
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Guys?
Guess who's back in show business.
What's up?
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Woooo!!!
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Hey!
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
BEND OVER?!!!
Thank you.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Like what?
Get off!
Hey.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Or... Dick.
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Yeah, all right.
What's an identical hand twin?
F-hah.... flennin....
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
I bet he can.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Your tax dollars?
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
I love you!
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Hey!
I don't sound like that.
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Ross came in forth and cried!
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Oh you knew that. Good!
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
Yes!!
Oh yeah! With who?
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Okay.
She?
Then what?
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
It's a four.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Yeah?
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
All right! I found one that fits!
Not if I kiss you first.
No!
Yeah, me either.
Here goes.
And last but not least.
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Hey.
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
No!! You can't!!
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
4:00 A.M.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Should we call the spitter?
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
What?
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Oh my God!
Hey!
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
What about things that are already gold?
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
That's the perfect amount!
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
... And where's this money coming from?
What?
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Yes!
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
What are you talking...
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
Funniest? Heckles?
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Okay, but now see you're crying!
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
Yuh-huh.
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
All right.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
But those are the words! Those exact words!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
No, ten o'clock.
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Here we go, here we go.
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
The hot chicks?
No.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Hey!
I'll cancel the sodas.
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
You can be the best man when I get married.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
I think I should get the chair!
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
And was the curse lifted?
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Yes, it is.
No I didn't!
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Why her mom?
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Yes because uh, you look so young.
Happy plane-aversary.
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Wait, we can't do this.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Y'know what, pretty good.
Sure...
What?!
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
She was not good. Not good.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Peter Parker.
They put you in jail?
Who?
For three years?
I think that's gum.
Fine with me.
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
Hello!
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
No, we'd just like to close them.
And I just want a million dollars!
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
I hope she throws up on you.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Really? Male nurses?
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
No, you should.
I didn't know you had another level.
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Oh they didn't want to come!
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Okay.
Listen to me!!
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
That's totally understandable.
Do I ever.
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
All yours babe.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Hey.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Hey.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Lovely!
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Okay, let's play my game now.
Who are you going out with?
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Ohhh.
But, we'll stay here with you.
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
Are you actually saying these words?
Chicks don't swim.
Oh, the mixed tape.
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
He took my essence!
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
Uh, Ross?
You're right, I know.
I love you.
Yes that was mine.
What are you doing?
You know...Oh My God.
You think?
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Yeah we do!
No, it came out to an even twenty.
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
Yes.
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
Emotional Knapsack?
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Thank you, Ross.
Okay!
Really?!
Me.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
We should always always break up together.
Oh my God!
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Yeah.
Okay.
Check out the ring.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
That is true.
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
That's what you say at the end of a date.
I am sorry, Ross.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Could I play?
Thanks!
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Uhh, no.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Hey!
What?
Hey!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Really?
Well then maybe you should take it.
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Rent?
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Do I still call you Ross?
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
You got your passport?
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
You think I should?
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Yes! Well that-yes.
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Whoa ho.
Absolutely!
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Yeah, o-okay.
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
And, a lemon lime.
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Monica said wedding.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Not bad.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Noo.
Ok, that's me.
What?!
I have my reasons.
Hey, it's me.
Janice?!
That's... That's was...
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
What, what's what you mean?
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
I'm off the list.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
I'm getting dressed.
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Hey, all right!
When'd you meet her?
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Those were like the best seats ever.
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
What about him?
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
He will, Joe.
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
You burn your mouth?
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
I know.
Don't worry.
Hey, Lowell.
Hey!
You mean like, music?
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Big dog?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Hey!
No, I'm not!
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Yes. Yes.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
Yes.
H-He's in China!
Goodnight.
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Uh-oh.
I know, I still am one of these.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
You guys wanna eat here?
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Really!
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Batman has the Batmobile!
What?
They'll never understand!
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Oh yes.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Okay.
Hey.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Out loud?
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
No!
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
I don't care! I don't care!!
Hello, children!
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Are you aware that you're still talking?
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Santa? Really?
Yeah, I know but...
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Oh, hey!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
No! No! Not, Paris.
Chelsea.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
I KNOW!!!
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
What picture?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Okay.
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Hey!
Whoa! Don't know about that.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
What?! What-what is it?!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Hey!
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Aww.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Uh, could you leave me one?
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Stop making candy!
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Lick away my man.
Stop it. Stop it!
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Hey!
Ross, don't. Ross!
Hey.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Okay.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Hey!
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Could you get us a couple of beers?
Hey! How'd it go?
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Hey!
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Cookie?
Okay. I'll be right there.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Why are you screaming and hugging?
I mean, I was sitting there.
Here just...take this.
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Hi.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
You're turning into a women.
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Thanks.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Yeah!
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
