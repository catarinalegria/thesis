I like her.
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Where have you been?
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
You.
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Yeah.
But I love swing music!
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Hey, you feelin' better?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Hey.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
I don't know.
So?
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Peter Parker.
Before!!
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
You'll get one.
That.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Well, I'm there too!
Okay, hating this.
Absolutely!
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
I can't believe it.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Okay.
Okay, absolutely!
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
No.
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
More coffee over here, please!
All right.
Ohh, that's a good one.
A woman's
But you found the keys to his clothes?
Janice, you're--
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
Your sister Ursula.
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Huh.
What?!
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Okay!
Chicks don't swim.
Monica's wasted.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Yeah?
You okay?
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
It's a great idea.
Yeah! You wanna come?
She?
Go on.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
You're turning into a women.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Can you people not see me?!
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
What's your point?
Okay.
Yes, it is.
Do we dare?
Fancy guest.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
What? What?
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
You're right.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
I'm gonna put on some music.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
Oh, good job Joe.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
You said no right?!
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Do you know why?
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Of!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
B-bye!
Don't worry.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
No!
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Hey.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Okay.
Well, we are great guys.
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
No!
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Phoebe.
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
Okay.
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
What's this?
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Oh, good!
You gotta let me slam the door!
What's up?
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Do either of you have the keys?
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Flashdance.
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Hey.
He took my essence!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
I'm not yanking you.
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
You do know that Wham broke up?
I'm sorry!
Yes, we were just...
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Look at this!
And I just want a million dollars!
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
He will, Joe.
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Okay!
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Okay, keep saying it!
Hey.
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
So what does this mean?
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
The abridgment.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Oh my God!
What?!
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
He just said, "No strippers."
Okay, I'll do it!
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
You said...
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Uh, Julie.
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Have you ever been with a woman?
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
I'm the ruptured spleen.
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
You have to pick your moments.
What am I gonna do, huh?
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Happy plane-aversary.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
So, what do you think?
Hey! Happy birthday.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Really.
Way to be cool, man.
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Thanks.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Are you serious?
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Whoa, she's pretty.
Okay, okay, you got it!
Nine.
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
...The second guy.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
What does she do?
No way!
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
I hate this thing!
Ehh.
So I got ya something.
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Uh, HELLO!!
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Yeah, it is the best.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Hey.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
What, what's what you mean?
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
What is the matter with you ?!?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
The one that doesn't.
What's the matter honey?
How did you...know?
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
See ya.
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Okay, great.
You are beautiful.
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
"Benefits lapsed."
Yeah. Right.
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Me.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
What? What?
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
What gave me away?
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Isn't Ben in this?
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
No!! You can't!!
She's one of us now.
Why would the baby creep me out?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
The food there was, was great.
Hey.
Sure.
You are so great! I love you!
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
What are you doing?
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Are you funny?
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Thanks!
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Well, did-did you correct him?
Coffee in a fight!
Ohhh.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Hey.
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
You understood that?
Stripping!
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Yes?
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
I don't care, she slept with me.
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
What are you talking about?
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Yes, I realise that.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
I-I think we have too.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
It still doesn't work.
It happened in London.
You mean you didn't get it from this?
No I didn't!
I know.
Well that's a full cup!
Hey!
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Uh-oh.
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
I thought your time ran out.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
What?!
Yeah.
Our next cocktail party?
That's the perfect amount!
Oh, you must stop shooping.
So you really OK about all this?
It's a four.
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
What are you doing?
But you found me!
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Why?
Monica.
That is lucky.
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
WHAT IS IT?!
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Joey... Switzerland?
That's easy, baggage claim.
Umm, yeah.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Sorry Phoebe.
Nice try.
Nothing, nothing.
Yeah.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Can we start over?
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Well, I guess that's something.
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Love what you've done with the place.
All right, buddy!
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Alright, let's do this.
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
I've got five bucks says you can't.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Fine!
Oh hi!
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
I'll cancel the sodas.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Sorry.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
So-You got in voluntarily?!
Isn't she cute? No!
What happened?
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Really?
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
...little playthings with yarn?
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Is that a swing?
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Oh, yeah.
She's just doing her job!
Aww, man!
Whoa! Don't know about that.
You can be the best man when I get married.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
'Kay.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Cookie?
Ow!
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
So, let's go.
No, you should.
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Really?
Oh, that's mature.
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Mar-haaaan.
That's right.
That's sweet.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Batman has the Batmobile!
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
How did you? How? How?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
I love you.
So what are you gonna do?
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
Forget it, that's off.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
There you go.
Whoa!!!
I didn't know that.
No I didn't!
No!!
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
I just saw Janice.
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Hi Monica.
You got me.
Pheebs!!
Joe?
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Hey!
Absolutely.
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Defend yourself.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
There you go! There you are!
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
With extra pulp?
Hm-hmm.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Okay.
I can't believe she's married.
I can't smell your sandwich?
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
Okay.
Hi.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Hey.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
What?
Basically we just feel that he's...
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Yep!
Work on your music?
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
What? That's terrible!
What?
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
No!
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Hey.
Hey.
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
I'm not breaking up with her!
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
Ehh.
It is?
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
He's really picky about his patients.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Well?
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
What'd you rent?
Theyre twins!
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
So, I guess this is over.
You know it?
Stop talkin' to your men.
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Nothing.
It's me. I'm the other guy.
You're it! Now run and hide!
What is the matter with you?
Okay man.
Ahh-hahaha!
And to you too, Helen.
Hey, all right!
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Really?!
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
No-no-no-no. Hey!
Okay, so he's out of here.
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Oh my God!
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
Without me?!
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Hey!!
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
So it did go well.
Paid your phone bill?
Your cappucino sir.
Santa? Really?
BEND OVER?!!!
What?
Our guy has great hair.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
What?
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Okay!
Uh-oh.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Ohh yes.
It's 6:00.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
What gay thing?
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Yeah!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Who jumps at loud noises!
What?!
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
So uhh, how's the palace?
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
You mean like for award shows?
You look good.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
We already knew that!
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Check out the ring.
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Thank you.
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Hey!!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Hi! How'd it go?
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Well, only if you order stuff.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Oh my God!
Yeah!
As crazy as soccer?
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Aww!
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Hike!
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Might wanna try Joseph.
They'll never understand!
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Well, what did the police say?
Okay.
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Okay.
I said art lover.
I'm back.
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Why not?
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Come on in.
Too?
Hi there!
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
What's going on?
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Why?
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
What?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
I can't believe she cracked your code!
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Why not?!
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
She was not good. Not good.
What?
Nice!
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
I don't know. Should we try it?
Condoms?
Nice try.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Oh, what the hell is that?
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
All right, I'll pick that one.
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
So they're going on dates? When?
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Still broken?
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Oh, you're-you're going?
How is that worse?!
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
What?!
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
How are you feeling?
You know, you think I would.
Me! On my computer.
You gotta do it, man.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
Hey Rach!
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
8. 8!
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
The man's got a point.
Isn't this amazing?
So--You got in voluntarily?!
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Hey!
Bye.
What's going on?
So, how many have you sold so far?
Is it on?
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Surprise!!
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
And Milton Berle has a...
Oh yeah.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
You pick one.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Oh yeah!
Okay.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Relax your hand!
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
That was Joey!
It was a car backfire!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Oh-ho, yeah!
Well this is just sad!
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
This took you all day?!
Yeah, I'll go get one.
That's great.
That was so lame.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Uh-oh.
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Who said anything about Christmas?
And twenty-five it is.
Wh-what?
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Okay.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Yeah.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Oh my God!
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
He's taking off her coat!
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Oh yes!
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Yeah?
It's not a real game! I made it up!
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Another hard 8.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Okay!
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Ummmmmmmm, no.
What Richard thing?
Yeah!
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Hello? Hello?
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
You don't have it.
Hello!
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Sure, why not?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
The reason he just said.
Bye! Thank God
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
Yeah! All right! You go first.
No we didn't!
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
I don't want to say.
I don't know.
Hey.
Richard!
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Do you want me to call?
Where's Monica?
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Oh, they're a hoot.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
And you're our age. You're our age.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
H-He's in China!
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Okay, good.
Bye!
I did, but...
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
You got waaaay too much free time.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Whoa!
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Like an eclipse.
You know, I think I might just.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
What???
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Hey Joe.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Hmm.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Where's Mary-Angela?
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Joey!
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
What are you doing?
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Okay, who wore those?
Oh God!
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
What?
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
Refill?
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Yeah, I know but...
Prague?
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Forget it, that's off.
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Take off your shirt!
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Had it.
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
No way!
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Sorry!
Could you want her more?
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
It means we're holding hands.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Okay.
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Boys? We're going in.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
And there's daddy!
Staying out of the way.
I didn't know you had another level.
Hi Monica.
Okay great.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
No, you're the best.
Youre not gonna lose him.
Ahhhh.
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
What do we use to split it?
OH MY GOD!!!
Joey! Joey!!
You ready?
An old cookie?
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Hi.
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
That's laughter.
Did you see Betty?
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
Easy tiger.
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Okay .
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Hey!
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
I would really love it if could do both.
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Any contact?
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Alrighty.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Oh my God!
Hello.
Sorry man.
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
That's what they'll call us.
Give him money? It was a joke!
I don't sound like that.
What is going on here?
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Okay.
Yes he did.
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
What are you doing tonight?
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Why two?
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Your work makes me sad.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Hey.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
No!
Oh, are we playing this?!
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Hey!
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
No, we only went out once.
Ok, Phoebe.
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Ok, you can have it.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
My friend's name is Joey.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Okay, one question.
No, not us... Us!
Ross came in forth and cried!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Orange juice.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Yes!
What?
Nope, not under here!
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Yeah.
Hey.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
Nope, not under here!
Hey.
Well there you have it!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
We were playing poker, alright...
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Nice shooting!
Okay.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
You are a frightening, frightening man.
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Noo!
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
I don't know, I'm very tired.
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
: I thought we had them!
What happened?!!
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Well, what is it?
Hey.
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
The nerve huh?
Or Casey.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Chelsea.
I kissed Kathy.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Yes!
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Yeah, check out the ring.
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Oh-no, he's right.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
It's a buffet man.
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Um-mm, yeah right!
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
I have no idea.
You know...Oh My God.
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Hi, it's me.
Why is that so funny?
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
What?
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
That's what you say at the end of a date.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Okay!
All right, I'm nine years old.
Oop!
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
We're worried about you.
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Hey.
It's exactly like it sounds.
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
You're naked in this picture!
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Guess who's back in show business.
Goodnight.
Could I be more sorry.
Okay!
What?! Ow!
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
I'm getting dressed.
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
Fine! Maybe I will too!
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Hi, oh hi.
Are you Joey?
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
And?
What?
What was tonight?
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Again true.
Wait, wait, wait.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Who?
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Okay, we owe you a present.
I am sorry, Ross.
Yes.
Long!
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
There I am!
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
It's my joke.
All right.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
What?
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
'Cause it's gross.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
I can't believe this.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
How could it not matter?!
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Okay.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
FREE PORN!!!
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Uh, if you say so sir.
I don't think so.
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
All right!
Really?
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
What's going on?
My-Oh my God!
Big bullies!!
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Ohhh. Don't go.
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Okay, come here! Come here.
Oh yes!
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Yeah, like in a cab...
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Oh, so that's what this is for.
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
So was I.
Y'know what would work?
Let's go.
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Picking Rachel.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Yeah, I do.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Hey! How'd it go?
Huh.
All right.
Okay.
Why can't you tell her?
Always illegal Joe.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Yes!
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Two hours, that lasted!
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
And condoms are the way to do that?
...I'm, I'm okay.
Okay, anything for you sir?
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Good-bye muscles!!
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
And I think Ross is generous too.
We should always always break up together.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
Bye.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Really?
Great! Okay, here.
Fine.
You wanna share it?
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Okay.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
No sir.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
You totally screwed him over.
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Ross is Batman!
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Our minister...
Chandler.
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Okay. All right.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
Whoa, snowing out there?
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
What stupid thing did you do?
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
I can't believe you did this.
See you later.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Bad London!
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Plus, you look cool.
Oh yeah, totally!
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
I said, "Like what?"
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Oh, hey guys!
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Oh my God!
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
: What do you need, what do you need?
I bet he can.
Hey.
How is that ever going to happen?!
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Freedom!
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
What was that?
Okay. Thanks.
Ahhhhh!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Not fun anymore?
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
I have some moves.
Hey!
Hey!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Okay.
...Hm.
No reason.
Yes that would have made more sense.
All right! I found one that fits!
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Well, that went well.
Hello!
You did look like an idiot.
What?
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Happy New Year!
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Hey!
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Yeah.
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
So what does this mean?
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
So what happened?
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Could be Casey.
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Do I look fat?
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
OK, stop.
We actually missed it.
OK.
Does for me.
What are you guys doing together?
I didn't think I was!
Okay, I gotta go to work.
Oh, good. Rog is here.
Hey!
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Okay.
Did she call?
Noo.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
No I didn't!
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
You don't know?
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
If it helps, I could slide over.
What about him?
Yes! Well that-yes.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
So are we...friends again?
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
I KNOW!!!
Oh, this is not that bad.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Joe?
I'm sorry, who?
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Okay.
Having a swim.
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
...Dinah?
What?
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Joey, no means no!
In the game room!
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
You remember Janice.
It's okay, I got a plan.
Hi!
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
What did you guys just do?!
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
All right, maybe I should call her.
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Hang on buddy!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
No! You're the sweetest!
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
Oh my God!
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Sure...
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Oh! It's on! It's on!
Well, you're gonna.
No, I'm not!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
Okay.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
How?
Help!
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
...Quality, right, great.
He took my joke, he took it.
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
What do you mean?
Yuh-huh.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
But you're still my friend?
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
When'd you meet her?
No?
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
I think they get it.
Hey!
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
No thank you.
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
OK.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
Hey Joe!
What, like a number?
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
You knew about this?
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Thanks.
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Hey!
Yeah, alright.
No. No! No! No!
Hello!
Tell it again. Seriously.
Oh, my, god!
Hey!
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
Yes, he is!
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Hey.
Hey!
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
I KNEW IT!!!!
Yes.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
A pharmacist.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
So what was it for anyway?
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Okay.
You built a fort didn't ya?
Hey!
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Really?
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
What are you doing out there?
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Hey!
How much did I love The King and I?
You're welcome.
The one time they're not home.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Why?
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Hey.
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
They're still just friends, right?
Oh yeah!
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Yeah!
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
What about the time difference?
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
Phoebe knows about us!
Okay.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Really?!
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Did she freak out?
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
We don't need to remedy that.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Ok.
Ni-hi-ice!
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Taste it.
Hey, big guy, game time.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
You think?
Here it is! Here it is!
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Hey!
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Oh! Yeah!
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Ahhhh!
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
It doesn't scare me!
Eh...
I know.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
What?
I am now!
OK. Brake left, gas right?
Aahhuuhhh....
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Hey!
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Huh.
I'll catch you guys later.
Pierce Brosnan?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
Hi there.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Congratulations!
Great!! That's great!
Well ah, ........y'know.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
Seriously?
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
What about the birds?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Oh my God!
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
All right.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Skull?
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Well it's very unsettling.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
He thought you said gonad.
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
So, rocks.
You're welcome.
Yes that was mine.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Oh o-, OK man.
Yeah.
That's great!
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Here.
Hey!
All right. Very good.
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Ok, you can not do this to me.
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
Hey!
Okay!
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
You have done enough!
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
That's not specific to girls.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Oh all right.
In a foreign, romantic country...
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Hey.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
No we didn't!
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Very informative!
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
I think that's gum.
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
What is it doing here?
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Hey, sweetums.
All right, ready?
It's horrible.
Hey, Pheebs!
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
But...
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Yep, pretty much.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Well, I, I should go in there.
Ah!
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
We don't, really.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Knock, knock.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Uhh, no.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
You done?
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
...He's in.
Oh, good!
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Bad London!
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Hi.
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
Eh?
Who are you going out with?
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
So, this isn't over?
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Y'think?
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
Ohhhhh!
Okay, that's enough honey!
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Where ya going?
What are you doing here?
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Cups.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Ya know, the man's got a point.
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
You look great!
Hey, Mon.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
More importantly, was I any good?
Phoebe knows about us!
And a date with a man!
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Oh come on!!
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
I spelled out boobies.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Because, I'm too afraid.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Well then why can't I see it?
Sure I would!
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Hi Joey's sisters!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Well, this is much better.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
We are bad people.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
I can check that for ya.
What? What can't you do?
Yeah?
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Ohh, yeah.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Oh yeah! With who?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Why?
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
I so am.
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
What?
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
Yeah?
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
No-no-no-no-no!
You left a shoe here?!
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Hey!
What? What? What?
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
I'm marrying her.
What?
Okay.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
I don't like your massages.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Why don't you open with a joke?
You guys wanna eat here?
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Hi.
Ross.
Oh, hey.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
I don't know.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
No, the little girl creeps me out.
Hey!
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
You are really frightening me.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
I think it's winning.
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Why not?
Put Joey on the phone.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
Hey!
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
You're shooting with Althea?!
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Hey Pheebs!
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
I got the time to get to know Julie.
Isn't that Ross's money?
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Could we be more white trash?
Bye, Pheebs!
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
What?!
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Yes, include more people in this.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
