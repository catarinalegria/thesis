Wow! You are really good at this.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Are you talking about having sex?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
Oh, excellent.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Very tasteful.
Hey guys.
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
This should be fun.
Do you?
I think we're here.
Hey!
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
How are ya man?
Oh look at you! So handsome!
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
Are you remaking the bed?
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
I think we've seen enough!
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
Ahh.
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Oh, me too.
You always said I'd make it.
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Yeah. Yeah. A little.
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Um, coffee to go, please.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Wow!
I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
Monica.
No help required Chico.
Hey!
Really, y'think so? I don't..
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
Y'know what? We need to move on.
Did you cut this couch in half?
That's the one.
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
That's about 60 cents.
Are you interested in this ring?!
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
Hey, it's everybody.
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
Aren't you going to swallow that?
Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
Noo! NO!
Coffee.
Rachel?
No we won't.
My job!
All right, let's do it!
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Alright!
Cut.
It was fine.
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
Joey, onstage!
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
We have our babies?
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Hi!
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Oh, thanks.
Oh no.
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
Oh good.
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
What are you doing?
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Yeah! Punch him!!
Would you like to see them?
I'm so sorry!
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Oh.
Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Wait! Hold on! Hi!
Meet me in the bathroom.
Did anybody call for security?
Thank you.
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
How's it going?
Hi.
Yeah! Yeah, we can!
It's this way? Sorry.
What like Pete Dakota?
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Oh crap!
Thanks. You want it?
There you go.
Hi!
Not really.
Ohh.
How, how is this my fault?
So is Joey around?
Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
No. No, I haven't seen him.
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Who's doing shots?
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
Well, they don't have to know that...
Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
Do you want a date Saturday?
Really?
Ross, they are killing you out there!
Good.
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Thanks.
Hi.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Kristen.
Well kinda old, like 30.
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
Eee!!
Oh my God, Rachel!
Worth a shot, huh?
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
Oh thank you.
I love you Phoebe.
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
I really like waking up with you.
...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!
Hey! I missed you.
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Just the last two pages.
Red Barbra?
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Alrighty. From the top.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Joey!
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
Honey, honey, people are looking.
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Hi.
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Your license?
Okay.
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
As were you.
No, I-I-I gotta go.
She's not making me uncomfortable.
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Eh.
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
Hey!!
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
So what do you want?
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
Okay.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
It's my sister.
We've got a problem.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
I'm a little embarrassed.
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
Where?
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Thanks.
What're you doing?
No one likes a buttmunch.
What're you doing? Are you scratching?
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
I gotta go.
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
13.
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
Oh-no.
You too.
Bye.
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
Yes.
That's where you pick up the bag.
Sorry. You look good too.
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
He started it!
Hey.
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Hey Rachel!
No.
You don't think I'm cute?
Oh yeah!
Put your balloons down!
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Ok, you really want me out?
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
We appear to have angered it.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
M-Me again?
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
What do you mean?
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Hey.
It was Max's stuff.
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
She's here.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Yeah.
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
What do you see? What do you see?
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
Yeah.
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
Yeah, that's what I said.
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
I can do that.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Chandler?
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
Joey, this is awkward part.
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
Bye bye Joey.
But, you're not identical twins.
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Excuse me?
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Which one?
Great. That would be fine.
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Sorry.
You're strict.
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Sure.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
I'm sorry.
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
Where have you been?
It's the Gellers!
What?
Who?
Minsk. It's in Russia.
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Shhhh!
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
But like how?
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
What?! Why?!
On your back... Mom.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Well that's ambitious.
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
Um-hmm.
Oh, just years of experience.
I see the head.
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Are you wearing my glasses?
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
I know that.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
No problem.
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
Are those your teeth??
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Rachel stop!
Nope.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Hey!
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
It's Alan.
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
Hey! Rachel!
With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
I hate you!!
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Hi Kim.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
Yeah.
Adios.
I'll even let you ring the bell.
Okay, I'll see you in our room.
You mean they're lovers.
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
She's not a twinkie.
Oh, Liam.
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Yeah?
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
Yes.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Thomas, come back here!
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
I knew you'd understand.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Ohh, I'm sorry.
I thought of a thing.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
He's not here right now.
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Absolutely!
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
To get my coat.
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Ready, Annabelle?
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
All right.
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Ooooohhh.
Well, that was ah...
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
I'll talk to her.
Waitressing?
Exactly.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
And some biscottie cookies.
Thanks Phoebe!
Of course! It's her favorite.
Oh.
We were playing rugby.
Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
Um, I'm not.
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Oh no.
Sure.
Of course, sir.
Hey.
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
Oh yes there is!
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
Woooo hoooo!!!
Oh.
Yeah, refrigerator college.
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Fine.
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Good-bye! Good luck!
Hey! Sugar-O's!
It's, uh, it's Paul.
But were fine.
Bye.
Your not doing it.
I love you, love you.
He touched my fanny.
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
You owe me a waffle.
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
You have a son?
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Hey
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Hey!
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
Okay!
And he was my best student.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
He does that?!
Hey!
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
So we can go out again?
Hey.
Yeah! As long as we're here!
It was my quarter!
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
"You have two new messages."
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
Yuh.
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Uh, you guys?
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Well, I'm from California.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
C'mon.
We've only known each other for six weeks!
What kind of surgery?!
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
It's not here.
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Hey guys.
8!
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
No Santa? Was I bad?
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Hi!
Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
I'm talkin'!
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
I had a sister.
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
My God, what were you thinking about?
Really?! You?
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Yeah! Oh my God!
Oh, god.
It's me!
Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
Yeah.
When?
No dear. It's not.
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
No, thank you. Chandler!
We don't need any toner.
Everybody has to audition.
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Bye Joey. Last night was fun.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Yes. They're insanely white.
Done!
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Your license please.
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
So uh, who's your photographer?
Sure.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Ok.
Dudes.
I feel great. In fact! What?
Can I please see your face?
We're so sorry.
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Plate?
Is it true they have beer?
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Ohh great.
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Okay, Chandler, come on!
Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
Oh my God!
Your mother just added him to her list.
Hmm?
Yeah.
Hey!
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
Oh, I love you too. But...
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Oww!!
Really? About what?
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
So you guys want me to take this back?
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Oh, great! Me too.
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
I know! I can't wait!
Hi.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
Oh!
Of course I do.
Uh-huh, I don't know.
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
No! Why does he have to go?
Hey.
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
Like lovers.
No.
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
Thank you so much for coming.
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Cut.
Woah!
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Um
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
That would work.
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Hi, I'm Maria.
Why the Post?
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
Why?!
Okay, we're not.
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Huh? What?
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Hello Skidmark.
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Please, let me do something.
How, how can you be here and there.
Where's your baby?
Yeah!
Oh that's great!
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
Yeah, what's the gala for?
Rough numbers?
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
All right.
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
What?
Yeah, come on in.
Hey!
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Well, she has issues.
Then, you're redoing it because...
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
All those things I said about not being ready...
Nope! That never happened to me!
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Oh, good.
Okay, bye!!
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
Hey! That's my car.
Please, can't you help me out?
I forgot my purse.
It's uh, $12.50.
So, can I get some candy?
Wow! Thanks!
I thought it was toner.
Wow, love your new nose!
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
Hi!
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
Can I get you something from the bar?
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Uh-huh.
Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
What do you see?
Good deal.
And the spitting?
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
Oh my God.
Just a small tranquiliser.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
Whoa!!
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
Phoebe?
You think?
Uhh, you said there was a party.
It's yours!
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Can I help you?
Honey, you are in it.
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Hi.
Ah, you... have the sex?
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
Oh my God!
Very, very bad.
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
Here you go.
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Ross, you remember Susan.
May I help you?
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Hey!
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
Yeah, it was.
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
Which guy?
Bye.
Oh. They don't.

Hello!
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
Maybe.
Wh-what's that?
Why?!
What are you doing here?
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Hey.
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
Kenny the copyboy.
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
No.
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Who are you?
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
Me too!
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Anytime you're ready.
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
So it's just your mother then.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
I know!
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
Oh, jeez.
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Hi!
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I know. I hate that!
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Like what?
What's up?
Thanks.
Hi Rachel!
I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Uhh, yeah.
Mon-Monica?
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Okay.
I heard that.
Bye!
Well ah, what can you swing?
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
Ewww!
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Oh.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
I did not!
Well that's wonderful. . . I
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
What? Alright, what about my two?
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Take thee Ross...
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
You don't need to fill these silences.
What?
So what's your name?
Oh, ok. Alright.
We're ok.
Really?
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
I thought he was with you.
What about shut up?
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
No, it's really good.
Chandler?
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Whad'ya mean no?
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
It wasn't my decision!
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
We will.
What's goin' on?
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
I am!
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Monica.
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
Uh-oh, busted!
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
Yeah, she was my best teacher.
Do I?
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
This is for the fourth grade.
To the Bings!
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
Okay.
Phoebe?
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
Rachel Green's office.
Can I get some ice here?!
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Well...
Bye!
Oh.
You're gonna kill me!
This?
Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
Yeah.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
No, no, they only said you.
Hi!
Who told you that?
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Rachel.
We did?
Yay!
Out!
Hi Kim.
Why not?
I could have birds.
Wine?
Hello everybody!
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
No, no, no.
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
Count faster.
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
14.
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
So umm, are we cool?
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
No, bribes.
What's up?
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
Daryl Hannah.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
What, you don't think I know that?
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
Any luck?
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
How are you honey?
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
The receipt.
Hallelujah!
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Okay!
Sorry, it's not.
Not her.
What?
Well, sure, that too.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
I know I couldn't. So....
Okay uh, however...
Why don't we what?
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Phoebe, listen...
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Dennis.
Hey.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
Uh, is your name Chandler?
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
Your mom called me. So is this her?
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
What did he say?
O-kay!
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
Really?!

You're an Aquarius, huh?
What.
Bye Phoebe.
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
Hi!
Do you want me to check again?
Hi.
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
Hi, Joey.
No you stop!
Hello?
Except stilts.
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Oh, okay.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
No more pranks.
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
Well, my nose got lonely.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
Brooklyn Heights.
Oh, we have our babies.
Hi! Hey!
Thanks.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
What's a matter with you?
You mean like watch?
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
So, all right.
Don't, I like it dirty.
Is it bad?
Hey! You're a good dancer!
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
No that's my assistant.
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
Hello. Hello.
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
Guess what, I got an audition!
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
I'm kidding!
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
Bon giorno tutti!
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Umm, yeah-no thanks.
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
Oh Fonzie.
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
They're all tourists.
Jack used to handle the finances!
Joey!
Good idea! Yes!
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.

Hey.
Oh Rachel, uhh...
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
Aww!
Two.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
That's okay.
Yes it does.
Is all this true?
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Okay!
Checking to see if it's even.
Great!
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Uh-huh, yeah.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Hey, you like pizza?
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
Wow! Well, welcome back!
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
What?
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
Hi!
Okay.
Push, push!
Thank you!
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
I got an extra one. You want this?
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
Scene 5, take 1.
Bye.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
Would you like some gum?
Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
You are so bad!
Yes, Waltham interiors.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
Your grandmother would have hated this.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Sure. What?
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
Fine. I don't like you!!
What? He's cute!
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Yeah, I'm all...in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
Look at this.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
Is this yours?
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Ow!
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
Hombre?
Hey, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Who's out there?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Aaawwwwww!!
Or your keys.
Isn't!
Hi, honey.
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
I don't know.
Hey!
As much as he needs.
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Are you gonna be okay?
Really?!
No, I just thought it was cute.
You did it twice?
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
Right! Okay.
I can show you an ID if you want?
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
Not.... helping!
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
Kitten?
Hmm, noodle soup.
It went under the table.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Thanks.
Hi!
No thanks.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
What's the matter?
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
I'm gonna try.
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
I'm right here!!!!
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Judy, the kids..
Excuse me?
And Action!
Sophie, get in here!
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.
First of all, it's on your ass.
Thanks.
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
You wanna dance?
Good luck!
Gotcha.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
It's not Rick.
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
I won! That was my quarter!
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
Hi Ross.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
All right, hang on!
Nooo.
And who is your friend?
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
He told on us?
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
What about the duck?
I can't believe this!
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
Oh, sorry.
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Umm...
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Oh I know!!
Is there something wrong?
It's open! Come in!
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
Way to go, Phoebe!
Actually, I should get going.
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
I missed this.
What? Do you think he likes me?
Can I help you?
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
All right, fine.
Can't hear you!
One second.
So are you his mother or his father?
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
All right, let's try one.
Hi!
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
Uhh, not that I know of.
We could write it down for you?
Yeah, we'll see!
You told on us?
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
I'll do it.
That's really a day shoe.
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Why? Are we done for the day?
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Scotch.
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Really?
Drink?
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
What's wrong?
What are you doing here?!
Would ya care to venture one?
Very bad!
What?!
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
I'm in love with you.
Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
What if you put them here.
Kate?
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
The dark of night has disappeared!!
Do you know who at my office?
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
Are you serious?
Ohh!
Okayyy!
Ugh. Ross!
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Is that true miss?
How do you know?
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Thanks.
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
We want candy! We want candy now!
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
Yes.
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Oh, sorry!
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
Some day, maybe.
Why would you think that?
You look very pretty today.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Hey! How's Ben?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
Actually they were Nana's.
Yeah, we are.
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Because I'm in love with you.
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
You are?
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
We'll go to a hotel.
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
No.
You don't have it anymore?
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
Went out with Joey.
We don't have to.
Did I put too much rum in here?
Oh please God, let there be a song.
It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
Nice uh, costume.
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
Joey...
COME ON!!!!
Is this true?
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Surprise.
That'd be great, thanks.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Oh.
Like what?
No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
Come on.
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Oh, you know what?
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Rachel! Rachel!
Kinda.
Ohhh.
Hi.
If that helps you.
Surprise!
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
Oh, so did I.
Eeaagh!
No, you can't use your watch.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
Bye.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Hi!!
What's you point man?
Chandler?
Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
No.
Really! You-you sail?
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
Just tell me the truth.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
That's it. That's my whole name.
All right.
Did you pick out the vowels?
Hey, Rach!
No, but I can't-
What do you, what do you think?
Oh.... my.... God.
You are so adorable.
Yesss?
Well, if you don't, I will.
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
No, I was working on my pottery.
Nice to see you Rachel.
Yeah?
Zelner.
Oh. Oh.
What a nice story!
What's with you?
I'm not on the list!
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Yeah.
Well, whatever works for ya...
That was an accident! And so were you.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
Hmm.
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Hey. Morning, dear.
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Back on in 30 seconds people!
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
He went out for groceries.
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Daddy!!
Actually, that's our three hole punch.
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
Oh, my.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Uh, the dog.
No thanks.
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Okay.
No.
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
Not to me.
But, we are.
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Horrible!
Hi!
Who?
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Rachel has those in burgendy.
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
If you want it to be.
I feel good! ...Who are you?
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
Could you guys help me?
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
What?
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Good for you.
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
Ross! Wait!
Joey!
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
What's this? Blue nail polish?
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Oh please!
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Hey you're in our seats.
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
Joey.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Yeah.
Where are you from?
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
Oh, maybe that's it.
Just us.
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
What's going on?
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Good one.
And while we're on the subject of news..
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
Fruitflies?
Oh, umm, all right.
Bed?
God, your hair sure is different!
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Yeah.
Uhh....
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
Woah.
Okay!
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
Oh, that's not what it means?
Yeah.
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
Hi, this is Richard.
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
I would really like that.
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Kiss me!
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Whoa!!
I have a little comb.
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
How did you know?
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
Are you okay? What's wrong?
Okay. Let's do it again.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
No, it's too soon for you guys.
You are playing American football?
I'm Marjorie.
Why are you yelling?
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
Everybody!!
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
He would like to kiss you.
How are you?
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
Talk to me.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
Hey, Ben! Hey!
That's it.
I'm Amanda.
All right, man!!
No, the man is a mess.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
Who?
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
Oh no!
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Gary.
Oh, am I on the radio?
That was...so good.
What about Julie?
You wanna go down to the office right now?
Sure! That would be nice.
Give me a 'for instance'.
Sure.
The one in the director's chair.
Cut! Wonderful!
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Thanks.
I'm a dancer.
Thank you.
Is that supportive?
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
I like Ross.
Oh damn, I hate that.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
Oh.
Obviously.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
What?
Why not?
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Oh my God!!
No, pretty much just a towel.
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
What?
I dropped a cup.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Stay.
Oh my God, I'm late.
Bing!
Oh, hi.
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
Have a seat son. Hey!!
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
Monica! Chandler!
Who's party is it?
Why?!
Thanks a million.
Yeah, is she really 20.
Heavy.
Hard quality.
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Are you sure?
Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.
You're not wearing the patch yet.
And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Well, this has been fun.
All right, from the top.
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
Oh hey! Here they are!
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Come in.
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
Well, you seem fine.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Wait! Where's my shoes?
Ok.
All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
Okay, I can let it go at eight.
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
I-I-I don't think so.
Rachel didn't you just light that?
What'd I get?
All right.
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.
Bye.
That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
Wow.
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Joey, right?
Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Right, okay, then no.
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Hi!
Also Monday.
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
That's not all.
Ah! Nora Bing!
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Happy birthday.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
It isn't.
You missed the exit!
Okay, I bought a boat.
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
Okay.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
Hi.
It does sound appealing.
A little what?
How you doin'?
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Hi.
Oh, boy, do they suck.
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
...and live forever as a machine!
You have?
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Elizabeth!
Yes.
You have all the answers, don't you?
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Geller!
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
You kids ready?
Ohh!
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
Yep.
Is your back feeling better?
Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
It's okay...
Now, which of you is the father?
Hey, hey Ross.
Well that's not true.
Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Hey, Weird Girl.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
When's your birthday?
Yes.
This does.
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Thank you. I'm from New York.
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
Yeah.
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.
Alright!
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
You're straight. I get it.
Doesn't matter.
Why don't we take it for a spin?
That dies with me.
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Hi darling.
Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
Hi, pig!
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
1...2...
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
Wait! You forgot your legs!
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
I got you...these.
I'll be okay.
Yeah!
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Yes, yes, do go on.
What?
Okay.
No no no!
Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
No, Joey!
What's that?
Hi, Ross.
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
Ross? That opens my cervix.
Hi!
Okay.
Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
Well there's one and there's another .
Oh hey, Pheebs!
We're on in 3, 2,
I didn't realize that she was so close.
We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
Awwwwwwww.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
Nooo!!
No! Come on!
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
Yeah-yeah.
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
Really? Like how?
It was, wasn't it?
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
They still want me for General Hospital.
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
Lovely, just lovely.
Hey, ready for dinner?
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Hi!
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
That's Hanson.
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
He's... new.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
I own this store.
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Ow!!
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Yep. Pretty much.
You may kiss the bride.
Come on over here, sweetheart.
Yeah.
Did you bring the toe?
Hey Phoebe.
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
She may have died?
Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
...of course you can kick his ass son.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
I'm Tilly.
Somebody called about a monkey?
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Well of course not, but you were very good.
G'night.
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
For Chandler!
I thought it was... quite tasty.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Grazie.
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
What's wrong, sweetie?
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
Hey.
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
Yeah, can I help you with something?
Shut the book!
Sorry, members only.
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
And now you'll see me buying it.
I-I'll call ya.
What?
They don't?
Who? Me the attacker?
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
Sure!
Right! But, I am sorry.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Diet Coke.
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
Thanks!
Yeah, isn't that great?
We're back on.
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
More of Grandma's teramisu.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
What? Is it my breath?
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
Yeah?
Oh good.
Yeah! That would be great!
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
All right. Here's your first baby.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Well, not just for you.
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Uh-oh, tunnel.
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
Someone in here.
See what you did.
Hey, you.
Alright, I'll call you.
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
What?
Lebanon.
Yes!
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Monica! Hi honey.
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
Hey!
Uhh, I can't.
Youre doing it again.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.
Okay.
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
You put your balloons down!!
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
We were just talking about you.
What's the matter?
Tell me about it!
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
Yeah, sure.
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
I guess you can.
I knew it, wow!!
Uh, may I help you?
What?!
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
Oh Hans.
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
I know.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
I'm sorry, I do that.
You're so bad!
What?
It's Pam.
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
You did!
Bye Phoebe.
Can't wait.
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Yes!
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Hey.
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
Wow!
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so...
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
All right, let's move on.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
You don't have, anything?
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Um, would you like to come in?
I have to get back to...
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
It's my baby too.
Oh great!
Oh.
Err... we know what we want.
What?!
Oh!... Right!
Okay.
Hope you had a nice flight.
That - that's an idea.
I sure did!
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
What?
You're saying, my wife is in you?
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Good evening.
Its Jake.
Uh-oh.
There you go.
Yeah.
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Why not?
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
You OK?
Yay!!
Yeah.
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
Ohh!!
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
I had them made special.
You okay there, slugger?
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Rachel?
Alright.
Hi! What are you doing here?
Well, up yours too!
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Yeah.
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
Take care.
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
It is Judy.
What?!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
What's going on over here?
Cut!
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Really?!
Oh, yeah!
You're dying?!
What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
You got it.
A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
Drops. Here, they're free.
A tad.
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
Amy!
How long do you want the cuffs?
Good-bye.
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Uh huh.
That might be fun.
Hey!
And cut!
Susan! Hi!
It's not that kind of anniversary.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Yeah.
No, it's you!
