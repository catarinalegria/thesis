Ahh, miss? More coffee?
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
Both of you?
You mean like exclusive friends?
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Two.
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
Where's Buddy?
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
It's a curling iron.
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
Wait! Hold on! Hi!
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Don't be too long.
Sorry.
Our little boy is getting married.
Hi Frank.
Phoebe?
Yeah?
Because we can remember them.
Phoebe?
I'm gonna work on that.
Hello, Ross?
She's your partner.
Oh, yeah!
I-I do though.
You don't have it anymore?
And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
I can still see you!
Aww!
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
Do it again!
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm...
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
I'll just throw them out.
Sorry. You look beautiful.
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Ross.
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Where's your baby?
A film in Guadalajara!
Are you going to eat that bread?
I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Yeah.
See.
That's it. That's my whole name.
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Want us to go?
Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
Yeah.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
He touched my fanny.
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
Oh, look at that.
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
O-kay!
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Maybe you should.
Oh sure. Vince?!
Ameri-ccan.
Hi, Lauren.
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
I could have birds.
Okay, everybody hold!
Chicken or small?
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
That's okay.
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
So how did you know I was even here?
Potassium.
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
It's us.
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
Well...
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Yes.
Good for you.
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
No.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
Hey, Chandler!
I love that idea!
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
Lovely to meet you.
Daddy!
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
What about Benitez?
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
You are!
Oh look at you! So handsome!
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
You have?
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Well all right, one thing happened?
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
Adios.
What the hell!!!
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
Would you.......Would you hug me?
All right.
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
I think you've got concussion.
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Hey.
No no no!
Really? About what?
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
All right, hang on!
Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
What?!
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
What's the matter?
Ohh, so cute.
I'll get it.
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Really?!
Thank you.
No, I ahh, had another idea.
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
Hey!
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
Breathe, breathe, breathe...
What are you doing?
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Are you gonna play?
Impressive.
Hi.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
How does it happen?
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
You asked him too?!
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Then, what's the problem?
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
So. How'd you guys meet?
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
Bye-bye.
Thanks a million.
Aren't you going to swallow that?
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
8!:
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Hello?
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Uh, no, Susan and me.
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
You suck!!
Yeah, it was.
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Hi.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
No, this is a loaner.
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
All right. I'll get my bag.
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Well...
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
How are you?
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
Yeah, whatever. Oh no.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
For Chandler!
Hi!
Earl Grey?
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
Hey!
Oh, thanks.
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
No.
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
Well, thank you for giving it back.
We've got a problem.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
We'll go to a hotel.
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I think I need a drink.
Are you close with them?
When is Santa coming?
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
I just did them.
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
And tell him what?
I didn't realize that she was so close.
Honey, honey, people are looking.
It is off. Right Ross?
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Do you want me to check again?
Just keep smiling.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
Oh, that's better then.
Here we go.
Hello Tilly.
You bet. Maybe some other time?
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Chandler is fantastic!!
Oh yes, there you are.
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
He would like to kiss you.
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
You can watch our tape if you want.
As were you.
Let's go!!
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
Did you bring the toe?
Your not doing it.
Hi!
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
One, two, three...
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Charlotte who?
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Hey!
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Well.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Ross? Ross?
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
Please.
What's in the cup, Ross?
You would think.
Then we agree?
May I see your boarding pass?
Joey!
I think he's stoned again.
Yes.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Ohh that's so sweet!
You told me I was the only one.
Oh, ok. Alright.
Tell me about it!
Bye bye Joey.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Good luck! Go get 'em!
No! They did!
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Op.
Saltines?
Doctors are wrong all the time.
That saves us a conversation.
Oh Hans.
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Are you being British?!
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
Are you Chandler?
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
I got it!
Who in the hell are you?
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
Hello?
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
Ok.
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
We're still rolling!
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Hey!
But my apartment is so...
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Si.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
What about it?
Hi, honey.
Okay.
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
Okay, Chandler, come on!
I saw Richard.
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
I'm not freaking out.
Joey, onstage!
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
When I was six years old.
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
I don't speak English.
What was that?
Stop it!
What's he talking about?
No, she touched mine first!
So you guys want me to take this back?
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Yeah, okay.
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
Uh, may I help you?
You want me to sing?
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
You had sex, didn't you?
MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Really.
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Hi!
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Good to see you too!
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
I'm Megan Bailey.
What is it, Tim?
Oh?
To get my coat.
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
No.
But, we are.
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
Alright, we'll share.
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
Hey.
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
Sure! That would be nice.
Were you this cute in high school?
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Yeah. Thank you.
I'm with Hamilton!
Hi, I'm Joshua.
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
Dope!
Hombre?
Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
How would you like to pay?
Mon-Monica?
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
Who?
Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Oh, is there a problem?
She may have died?
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
Hey guys.
Dr. Burke will see you know.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
Hey.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
I think I lost. Three times.
We're just friends.
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Help!
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
I am!
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
I know.
Mmmm!
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
My fish, Buddy.
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Amy!
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
Who are you?
Yeah. Oh.
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Hi!
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
Uh, they're not in it.
What happened son?
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Monana was very brave.
You too.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
He's got a girlfriend!
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
What?!
Fine.
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
I'll remember that.
Hi.
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Ahh, look at you, you look great.
Hey!
No, you can't use your watch.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
So am I!
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
That's really a day shoe.
It's okay...
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
That's so great for you guys!
Hey!
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
How you doin'?
What?
Why?!
Hey you guys!
Uh-huh, yeah.
No, it was. It was very very good.
Why not?
Hey!
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
Oh hey, Pheebs!
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
I can do that.
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
OK.
I found the picture!
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Knick fan?
Hi.
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
Don't, I like it dirty.
No more pranks.
No, the man is a mess.
Who's next?
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
No thanks.
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Wait a minute!
Hi!
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Three babies?
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and...
What does that mean?
Hey, Pheebs.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
Okay, okay.
And wait, I've got something for you.
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
You've been married twice?
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Pizza delivery!
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
All right, let's try one.
Hey, Phoebe.
No, bribes.
Where?
Eeeee!
I really like waking up with you.
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
All right, see ya Pheebs.
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
Not her.
Surprise!
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
You may kiss the bride.
Go! Come on! Roll!
Hi-hi Joey.
Bye.
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
I'm not allowed to have soda.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Yeah, big fan.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
No, I wanna melt it.
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Yeah.
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
Wow!
Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
I would really like that.
Phoebe...
Hey.
You did a good thing today.
We're gonna give it another try.
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
Doesn't matter.
Each.
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Oh hello, Ross.
Uh-oh!
Why would you say that?
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Hey guys!
Here you go honey!
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
Okay.
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Hey!
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
I can help with that.
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Okay, bye!!
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
Tomatoes are squishing.
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
That's fine, thank you.
N.Y.P.D!!
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Monica! Hi honey.
Why?
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
What like Pete Dakota?
I got you...these.
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
October 25th.
Uh-oh, tunnel.
Oh great!
Thanks.
I am Father Kalebasous.
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
Sooo, you've been doing this long?
So that's your second marriage in two years.
Life partner.
How are you?
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
She's not a twinkie.
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Whoooaa!
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
I'm the student.
No! It don't go up on the wall!
Sure, I'd like that.
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
And Rog.
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Yeah. That's okay, right?
No problem.
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
Uh, plate?
You're straight. I get it.
Ohh, I'm sorry.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
I don't think I should say.
Hi. I'm Monica.
Push, push!
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
No.
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
Just keep smiling.
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
Really?!
Let's take it from there.
I came to talk to you about Howard.
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
Yep, sucks!
COME ON!!!!
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
Hi!
Thank you.
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
I will go for that drink.
Uh, the usher told us to come...
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
Yes! I have it right here. Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Okay.
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Yes, at 4:00.
That's pretty much it.
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
Wow! Well, welcome back!
I suppose mainly sexual.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
You're a genius, Ross.
Come on in.
I'd rather not.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Hey. Hi Phoebe.
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
Chandler!
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
Okay, I'll do it.
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
No, I have faith...
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
So, would you like any dessert?
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Wasn't it?
Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.
Oh, I love you too. But...
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
Hi Monica.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
All right then, it's settled.
Which one?
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
What do we got here?
Bye.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
What's happening to your accent?
I've had a really good time tonight.
You're our third call tonight.
A moustache comb.
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk...
Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Why not?
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Bye-bye.
Yeah, move over just a little bit.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Great.
Fellas, these guys were here first.
What a nice story!
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
For what?
Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
It was.
Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
Daryl Hannah.
Hi.
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
Here, let me help.
What's going on over here?
Yeah?
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
I came to give you this and this.
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
You really need the bassinet?
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Wow! Skates!
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Ho-ho, I will.
I have nothing to do with casting.
What?
Well, we had a table in college.
Hello darling.
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
Bye, Richard.
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Well, it's nice to know that you...
Not me.
Hi Rachel!
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
Hi, Joey.
Noo!!
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
How's the hired help?
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Hey! Me too!
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Kidney stones!
Whoa!
Oh, I never could do it.
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Hey! You're a good dancer!
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Oh Jack stop.
What do you see?
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Hey Monica, it's Chip.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
What.
8!
What're you doing?
Can he handle the stick?
Fine.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
Okay.
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
Y'know it's ironic...
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
Ohh! That's great!
He's not here right now.
Oh my God, I'm late.
You look very pretty today.
Morning.
Call security. Pheebs, didn't you get fired?
You wanna touch it?
What do you think?
Charles.
What?!
You too.
Just the last two pages.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
No. You?
Jack.
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Why?
No dear. It's not.
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
Well there's one and there's another .
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Yeah! As long as we're here!
Okayyy!
Let's do this alright.
Wow!
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
You really sure?
I'm 16.
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
Well that's ambitious.
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
Excuse me?
Oh yeah. See you guys.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Well I tell you what...
I'm not coming back.
So how did everything go?
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
We can't do that.
Monica.
Isn't there?
Why?!
Really, y'think so? I don't..
That's sweet. Could I take her?
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
I gotta friend named Mark.
This is for the fourth grade.
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
What?
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
Hey!
Hey, buddy.
Thanks, any suggestions?
What?
An advance?
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
We were just talking about you.
It's uh, $12.50.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Yeah, I know, I.
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Definitely her.
Checking to see if it's even.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Ross? What's with the neck?
Don't, I like it dirty.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Well of course I am!
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
Hi Rachel!
I can't do that.
Are you sure?
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
Ross, you remember Susan.
Great. I'll ah, see ya then.
Good luck!
So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
I love you Phoebe.
But...
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Joey!!!
Why?
My parents are dead.
Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
No.
This almost never happens!
That would be great!
I'm a little embarrassed.
Hey, you like pizza?
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
You lost 13 million dollars.
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
Am I too late?!
Oh, hi Rachel.
Do I dare ask?
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
Really?!
Oops.
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
Hello!
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
Oh. Oh.
Your messages have been erased.
I'm kidding!
When's your birthday?
Ohh, nice choice.
Ross? That opens my cervix.
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
So...
What?
Julia..
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
Oh my God, who died on this?!
Sorry.
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
The Waltham Residence.
What?!
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
I wish I could.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Y'know what?
Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
I feel good! ...Who are you?
Okay.
I'm talkin'!
Wait, just a second.
Oy!
Oh, yeah. I know that.
What's the matter?
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Morning!
Ok, you really want me out?
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Oh, umm, all right.
Great!
Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
Hey, waiter.
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Who are you talking too?
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?
Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
A tad.
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Good. Bye!
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
Oh hi Phoebe.
All right, you two, stop it!
Mar-gha.
Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
Hi Phoebe.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
I'll help you dial.
So... We go eat.
I think that's fair.
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Ready?
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
You are so adorable.
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
Hello.
We appear to have angered it.
Me too.
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Doctor Ross Geller.
Hi.
I think we have an answer.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Excuse me?
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
Susan! Hi!
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
No, Joey!
Hello?
You're an Aquarius, huh?
We don't have to.
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
I'm Dutch.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
Hi.
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
What?!
Hey, Monica!
You're right. It was 37.
Is this guy great or what?
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!

I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Well, what do you want me to say?
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
Yeah! Yes!
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
But...
Hi!
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
Hi.
But were fine.
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
Oh, come on!
Hey.
Still rolling, annnnd action!
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
Or I'll hear you.
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!
Oh my god.
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
Really? Then why are you like that?
Ok.
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
First of all, it's on your ass.
Whad'ya mean no?
I'm wearing two belts.
What, wait, you mean like this?
Actually, I should get going.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Ahh, yes.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
Jack used to handle the finances!
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Okay!
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Yes!
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Thats unbelievable.
Oh no.
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
That's my monkey.
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
You haven't?
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
What do you, what do you think?
Alright.
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
Who's doing shots?
Really? You two?
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Nice car!
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Yeah, isn't he?
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
Yeah.
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
So, who's the lucky guy?
That's so great for you guys!
All right. Here's your first baby.
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Bye!
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Hi.
Okay.
Oh, I totally agree.
It was you?
Oh, say no more!
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
May I help you?
Yes...
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Oh, Ross!
Could everyone please take their seats?
Beep!
Horrible!
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
So.
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Oh yeah!
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
Hey.
Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
They-they-they can smell fear.
Do I know you?
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Look I just thought that...
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Hey there Ross!
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
All right, fine.
Chandler!
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
May I help you?
Awwww!!
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
How are we gonna get out of that one?
Uh, the dog.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
Yeah.
Hey!
Put your balloons down!
What?
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Was it her quarter?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
I love you, too.
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Are you talking about having sex?
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Yeah, yeah. Why?
Happy birthday sweetie.
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Yeah.
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
Hey!
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
You.
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Hola! Hello. Hello?
Is there a Julio here?
Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
Like it would help.
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
Professor Geller?
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
Poco... a leetle.
Ohh. Hi!
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
It's laminated!
Well, sure, that too.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
How could I have left them in the copy room?
Oh yeah, of course you don't!
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
Why?
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
What?
Uh-huh.
And who may I say is calling?
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
Yes.
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
What?
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation?
Oh man!!
Hi! What-what're you doing here?
Just those two!
So, this was uh, really fun.
Monica! Where are you from?
Wine?
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
I don't think so.
Good luck, babe.
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
I'm sorry?
Okay. You ready to push again?
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
L!
You must be so happy!
You have me!
A test?!!
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
That's my job!
Hey Ross!
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
What're you doing?
I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
Ohhh! Put it out!
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Cut.
Umm, Frank Buffay.
Hey!
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
This one's from me.
Oooooo....
Here are the audition scenes.
We never get smacked.
Do you?
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
Hey guys!
Yeah!
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Ow! Did you just bite me?
You mean they're lovers.
No, Frank.
Uh, yes.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
Nothing at all?
It did at first, but not anymore.
No kidding.
Really?
We were playing rugby.
Oh good.
None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
Hey.
It's a different building.
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Hey.
Um-hmm.
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
Yeah.
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
So.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
Chandler's a girl!
What?!
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Yep. Pretty much.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
Joey, bravo!
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
Oy.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Professor Geller!
Umm, I'm still here.
What?
I will.
Is Brian...?
Well, he's doing terrible!
Well, they don't have to know that...
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Hey Phoebe.
Great. That would be fine.
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
Oh! Okay! Phew!
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
No, but it did! Didn't it?!
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
Hi.
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
Oh, no thanks.
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Pizza!
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Did not, she did not wink at you....
You don't think I'm cute?
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
You don't have, anything?
Well, here it is.
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Oh!
What?
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
I can't imagine why.
Gay!
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Can I get some ice here?!
Hey!
I heard that.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
Oh, am I on the radio?
Yeah.
Are you okay? What's wrong?
I just had sex.
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
Well, I could cut it.
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Bye.
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Woah.
Got 'em.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
Great!
Hi, how's it goin?
Hi Phoebe.
What are you doing here?!
The guy with the gas?!
You have three new messages.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Here you go.
Hi.
Oh!
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
Oh, just years of experience.
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
Hello everybody!
Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
You have all the answers, don't you?
What's with him?
Hi.
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
What?! Why?
What woman?!
So.
Cheers!
Taxi.
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
Daddy!
You too.
Yeah, we'll see!
No Santa? Was I bad?
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Like this.
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
Hey, be right there.
I am?
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
I knew you'd understand.
No, don't worry about it.
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
I'm Gail.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
Umm, no.
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
How are you?
Um, now. Phoebs.
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
I'll see you later.
This is a glaucoma test.
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
I wish I could talk to her.
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Oh, is he hungry already?
It was my quarter!
You may kiss the bride.
It's nice to have a boyfriend.
What about shut up?
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
You have some life here, sweetie.
Well, somebody got some last night.
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
Bye Phoebe.
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
Okay!
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
Okay.
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Look, you don't want to fight me.
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Hello.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
That's funny. Who are they?
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Yes!!
What's going on?
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
Ah here, we brought wine.
No, it's really good.
Wow! That would be great.
Yeah!
Well...
Okay. I'll miss you.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Okay!
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
We have got to move!
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?

Here you go.
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
So ah, Monica ready yet?
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Y-, y-, you like that show?
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Just do it.
You have not changed!
Some day, maybe.
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Well, she has issues.
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
You're table's ready sir.
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
All right.
Ooohhh.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
What are you doing?
Are you serious?
Miss? May I help you?
...Yes?
Oh.
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
Maybe.
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
Hello.
Well, that was ah...
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
Looks good. I'll take it.
You're strict.
Why don't we start right now!
Oh please!
Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
Where do I know you from?
Yeah?
Really?!
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
Hello! Who's in there?
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
The what?
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Would ya care to venture one?
Nope! That never happened to me!
Ohhhhh!
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Hi! Hey!
Yes, yes, do go on.
And you knew about this?!
You had sex with her didn't you?
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Oh. Thank you.
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
E!
I thought it was toner.
Yes sir.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
What? Is it my breath?
Hi! What are you doing here?
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Yeah...
Hello?
Ciao, bela.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
I'm not all right.
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Yo!!
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Hey, Joey.
I can't believe it!
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
That's because they are.
Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Rachel?
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Oh John! Great!
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Great!
Wow!
Yeah, really.
Rachel?
Yeah, sure.
Hey!
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Almost time for cake.
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Would you like some gum?
Okay, Santa!
I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
Woah!
Joey!
Phoebe?
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Bed?
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
Oh, me too.
Hi!
Yeah, OK.
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
Hey!
Tell her what?
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Is that an expensive blouse?
You're doing it again.
No.
Uh-oh...
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
You want me to cancel it?
Ready?
Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Kristen.
Hey guy!
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
I'm ready!
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
I remember when we first got engaged.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
Are you wearing my glasses?
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
What's a virgin?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Nothing! It's an expression.
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Come on! Speech!
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
That's so sweet.
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
Whoa!
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Hi honey.
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Yeah?
May I see it?
This is from the woman at the bar.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
It's clean.
Where did you get this number?
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
France sucks!
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
Looks good.
Yes.
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
Oh.
Is she gonna be all right?
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
Hey.
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
Do you two know each other?
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
There is no father.
According to recent findings!
Mr. Tribbiani.
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
But we broke up.
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
So glad you brought someone.
Bye!
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
Um-hum, you're jealous.
Hi.
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
Thanks.
No! I mean he's nice.
I'm gonna try.
Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
A surfer.
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
Let it go, Ross.
That's okay.
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
Do you still work here?
Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
So, thank you for the delicious dinner.
Morning.
Wait. I wanna show you something.
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
Hey, everybody!
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
Ohh, it's a bit small.
Hi!
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Oh.... my.... God.
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
Will you call him?
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
That's great!
M!
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
You OK?
May I help you ladies?
Oh?
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
Take thee Ross...
What? Do you think he likes me?
The receipt.
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
So, all right.
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
So, so, did you hear?
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
Hey baby, I'm back...
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
I'll see you tomorrow.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
Yep.
Come on.
Twenty percent.
Yeah, it sure does.
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
Ross!
No you stop!
All right.
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Yeah.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Nope.
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
Anytime you're ready.
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Joey!
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
No.
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
Hi!
Hi Joey.
You by the door. In or out?
So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?
Hey!!
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
What's too much fun?
Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
You are so sweet.
C'MON!
Yeah, she was my best teacher.
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
What contracts?
There is a little child inside this man!
That's kinda sad.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
One more chance Ursula, please?
As much as he needs.
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
Baywatch!!
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Bye.
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
Um
One ticket to Yemen?
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
What in the name of hell?
Hi.
Ah, which ever is closest.
So what do you want?
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
I'd really rather talk to him.
What kinda noise?
Is it bad?
I am so sorry.
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Geller!
Who?
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
I just hope...
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Hey, how, how did you do that?
Hi.
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Nope.
Yeah, right.
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Yeah.
She's here.
It's for me.
You have three nipples?
No.
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
Hi! Hello!
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
You need these books.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Hey, can I ask you something?
The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
Why don't we take it for a spin?
Hey.
Things change, roll with em.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
We get high.
Hey Monica, how's it going.
Okay, you guys free tonight?
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
That might be fun.
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
Good choice.
Ahh!
Hi.
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
How are you honey?
C'mon, this is us.
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
We did?
Elizabeth!
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know.
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
What? He's cute!
Huh, good luck!
Oh, my.
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
What's this? Blue nail polish?
I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
Hi.
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
Oh I know!!
