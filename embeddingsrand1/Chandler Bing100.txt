That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Yeah?
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Fine, let's do it.
Hey.
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Okay.
What's going on?
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
What's the matter honey?
Oh.
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
No-no-no-no. Hey!
Not so much!
Fine!
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
All right.
Here goes.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Still broken?
Really?
Hi.
Can I just say one thing?
Hey.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
What is it?
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
It was the ring!
Okay .
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Hi, Paul, is it?
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
And protected them from a tornado?
Where ya going?
Nope, not under here!
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
But we don't know the neighbors.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
No we didn't!
Joey!
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
I do like that.
How is that ever going to happen?!
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Hey!
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Could you get us a couple of beers?
Oh no, you'll have to come.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Hey!
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
I didn't realize that.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
'Cause I was sitting there.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
And is this in case the house sneezes?
What?
Well it's not Sean Penn.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
What've you been up to?
Are we in London?
Work people? Nobody told me.
Oh-no, he's right.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Yeah.
I do?
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Hey Joe.
That's very funny. We done now?
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
