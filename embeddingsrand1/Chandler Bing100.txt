What are you crazy? That's a baby!
What did you just do?
Hey.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
We're not gonna lose to girls.
It's up to you.
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Wow, you look...
What?
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Hey!
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Hey Joe what's up?
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Yeah, okay.
And I'm cute too.
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
What?!
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Hey.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
I'm not seeing Monica.
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Ohhh!!
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
Ahhhh.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Really?
Oh, the mixed tape.
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
Hey!
Okay!
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
I can't help it!
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
All right...
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
So how's Mindy?
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Water! Water! Water!
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Ohh!
Yeah, like in a cab...
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
No, no, no.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Huh.
What? What? What?
...little playthings with yarn?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
What?!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
What are you guys doing out here?
No, no, no. No-no-no.
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
No. No!
: What do you need, what do you need?
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
