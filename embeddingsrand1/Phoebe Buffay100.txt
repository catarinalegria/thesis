Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
You know he's gay?
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Huh?
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Great!
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
'Kay.
Never mind, I got it.
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
We're all right.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Hey!
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Oh, what? What was it?
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Yes.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
This is so cool!
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Okay, I'm ready.
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Well, how much do you think he needs?
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
Wooo!! Hoo!!
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Cups? You're giving me cups?
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
All right.
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
Sing!!
OK.
I saw it.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
That would be great. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Okay, London 1...
Hey Rach.
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Should we do something?
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Uma Thurman.
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Okay. I'm going with you.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
He broke that.
Waxine!!
Hey!
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
You guys, he's beautiful!
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Our mom.
Uh-huh.
A dollar?
But we have to!
Ooh!
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
