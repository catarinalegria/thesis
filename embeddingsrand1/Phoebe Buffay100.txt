Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
I know! Robin is so gay!
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
She wasn't a hooker.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Ow!!!
I, umm, shut up!
How'd you know I was coming?
That's what I'm saying.
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Gum!
Duh!! Christmas!
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Hey.
Chuck Woolery?
Oh.
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
Yeah, I actually don't know...
With?
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Wh-why is that the best part?
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
Wherere you going?
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
What did he say?
Ooh.
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Nice try.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Ooh, now you lost me.
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
Nu-uh!
If!
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
I'd call that excessive.
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Shh! Get me out of here.
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Well, yeah.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
There it is!
I miss Rose.
You are so smitten.
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Remembered what?
Both!
You are just nonstop!
Fired! Why?
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
I can't believe you did that!
...like a...
I'm sorry.
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
Okay.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Hi!
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
So did Heldi show you the place?
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Oh here's a whole bunch.
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Ooh, I like cards.
What are you gonna do?
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
and...
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Hi.
