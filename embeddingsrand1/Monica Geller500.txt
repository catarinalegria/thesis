I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Joey, you don't have too!
'Kay, here you go.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
Do you know anything about women?
I'm gonna start getting ready!
What for?
Hi Chandler.
Only here.
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Tomorrow night.
Yes.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Please tell me you're stopping now.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Yeah.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Say it.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
They're still in my coat.
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
That you're not funny or sexy?
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Why don't you just call her?
Joey, do you work here?
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Oh.... my... God.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Ohh, fun!
Okay.
What?
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
What's goin' on?
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
You're his bitch.
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Yeah!
Uh-huh.
All right!
Phoebe that's crazy!
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
So, did I hear Poconos?
We'll be waiting for you...
Yeah?
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
There is no alley behind Macy's.
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
She lets you borrow them.
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
And they weren't looking at you before?!
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
What?! What are you doing?!
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Really?!
He's so cute.
There's my little boy.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
What?!
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
You love her!
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Hi.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
No.
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Oh May 15th.
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
You came?!
Well what did you send?
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
I think he's shy.
Chandler.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Unless!
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
What?
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Break!
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
He might still show up.
Really?!
Hey guys! Hey!
Okay fine, now Ross...
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
Oh, from who?
People! People say it! Come here!
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
You made pancakes?
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Really?
Dad!
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Wow.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
So, where do you want to go?
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Don't you have to pee?
All right then. Bye.
I'm sorry.
And some of us really have to pee.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Okay, I'll go!
Okay.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Thank you.
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
What?
I'm sorry honey.
You look cute in bubbles.
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
Okay.
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
Well, what happened?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Okay.
Oh my God, Richard.
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
We, we just wanna see the end.
What?! Oh.
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Yeah, it did.
You didn't.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Break.
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
You're kidding?! That's great!
Yeah, Ginger something.
Hey!
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Whoa! Are you okay?
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Oh... shoot.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Gimme them!
Does anybody want these?
Bye.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Oh, yeah.
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Okay!
Yeah. I guess.
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Ross.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Here you go. You can wear this.
Could you not look?
Fine!
Huddle up.
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Rach, here's your mail.
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Uh-huh!
Why not?
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Really?
What?
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Thank you.
Yeah baby!
I have no idea what you just said.
You gave her food poisoning!?
No, you?
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Please.
Really!
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
I know, it is isn't it?
Yes! Have you seen it?
I think so.
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Really.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Oh!
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
What was that?
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Fifteen minutes.
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
And you're not gonna do that.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Oh...
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Something wrong?
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Thank you.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Every year.
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Ohh.
Hey.
Chandler!
Not any more!
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
I'm really not deciding!
Oh.
Let me ask you a question.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Okay!
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Ohhh, nice.
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
It's pretty clear.
Stop it!
I am not wrong.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Just go.
About what?
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
I got it!
Hello?
What?!
Hi Ben!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Oh my God!
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
But I didn't.
What is it?
I like that. What?
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
This is my dress!
I have not been sick in over three years!
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
Hey.
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Carol moved her stuff out today.
We checked. A lot.
Really?
Ohh.
Can you go any faster with that?
What are you doing?
Duh-huh!
You're on the phone!
No, no, I don't.
Phoebe!
What are you up too?
Yeah, what is it?
No time for that!
Okay.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Why not?!
Please, just a little bit off the back.
Hey.
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
We do not have one of those signs.
I love you, Pete!!!
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
You said the baby.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
So what's Phoebe like?
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Joey, what's going on?
What?
What?!!
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Me too.
So then you know?
Oh God!
All right, you're hired!
What about the closeness?
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
You bet.
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
I mean really, think about it.
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
I'm so glad you liked it.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Hang on a second I just got in.
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
So, are you ready to go?
You wanted it to be a surprise.
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Are you through with that?
Another good point.
Okay. Here's the thing.
There were only twelve.
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Really?
That's okay.
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
I don't want a ghost.
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
I'll be right back.
Let go!
Emily's straight.
You had no right to go out with him.
Ross!!
There's more beer, right?
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
That's a good call. Right.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
Ohh!
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
What?!
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Oh, why is it unfair?
What?
What's the matter?
Hey.
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
Where?
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
Mom, I'm hungry.
Whatever.
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Where were your parents?
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Give it to me.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
I'm so glad you liked them!
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
So what're you gonna do?
Well, not anymore.
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
And his puppet too.
That's true.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
I know.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Alright.
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Well?
Everybody knows!
What!!?
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Hello, Chandler.
Really?
Hi!
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
Very good, so good.
Hey!
Very good.
We had a characturist!
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Does that smell bother you?
Thanks. I think you got it!
So, what are you saying now?
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
No.
What?!
It's hard for some people!
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Licorice?
How many fingers am I holding up?
You were invited?!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Oh, no thanks.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
This is disgusting!
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Nooo!
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Why?
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
What kinda things have you been saying?
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Yeah.
Why isn't it working out?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
